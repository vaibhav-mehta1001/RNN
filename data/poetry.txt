 

This day ends with the quiet
dignity of time spent well, it
fades into the blackness of
my memories from where it’ll
soon disappear, and the 
excitement I’ve felt today will
soon evaporate in this 
summer heat, replaced with the
weariness of a life lived too long, 
but it doesn’t matter because
even when this day is forgotten,
it will still have existed, even
when I fade into obscurity, 
no one will be able to take away
who I was, because the truth is
human beings fiddle with the
future like it’s a toy, they tie
Destiny’s hands together and
call their own shots, but
no matter how much they
try, the past is just not as
malleable, so even though they
have taken away my future,
they’ll never take away my past.



 
loving you feels like
coming home- something so soft
I don’t stop to think,
don’t wonder what could
go wrong, instead I just think:
this will never end.


 
sleep beckons me like a siren,
I hear it’s call everywhere I go
pulling my weary body towards it,
it never stops, so now it’s just
another daily noise I’m 
accustomed to, another 
disappointed murmur I’ve learnt to 
ignore, because as much as I 
want to succumb to it’s lullaby,
I have things to do, places to be,
this world doesn’t stop for
mental health, this world doesn’t
stop for physical health, this world
doesn’t stop for nothing. 
So when sleep calls to me, I ignore
it, adding it to the long list
of things I was to afraid to confront,
you see, the worst thing about sleep
isn’t what you’re missing out on,
it’s what you’re not, it’s what is
present in the dark, waiting for you.

thought about you on the subway today/ in the car today/ on the street today/ at the mall today/ in my bed today/ 
i let my imagination run wild/ hands clutching waist/ bodies pressed together/ never realised a love could be like this
never realised I could feel/ so deep/ so wide/ so chasm like/ guess you ripped my heart open/ because all I think about is you/
but I don’t mind/ the hum of my heart/ is in tune with the bustle of my life/ with the sound of my footsteps on the sidewalk/ 
I don’t mind/ why would I/ I know this music is leading me to you/ and sooner or later/ these vivid scenarios/ will be real/ will be true/ will be us.

 
 
I know I’m not good for much, just
another girl with a sob story,
know I’m nothing special, less 
worthwhile than a floor mat,  just
another girl people look past, but
despite the flaws that circle my
very being, despite the fact that I
never managed to shine bright, 
despite the knowledge that I’ve
disappeared in this galaxy of 
humanity, I know what I can do,
know that if I was put at the helm
of a ship I would guide it home 
with words, know that I’m not 
pretty, but almost resemble the 
notion when I talk about writing and
my eyes light up- So don’t
count me out just yet, every bone
in my body is made for this duty,
and every inch of my muscle 
strove to get me here, I might not
be good for much, but I’m good 
for this, good for you, so sit
back and watch me conquer, 
because I may never be fit to
control this universe, but I can
definitely control this portion.

 
 
 
Some days words seem to
float just of my reach, and
I watch them fly away, buoyed
by the wind until they become 
smaller and smaller, finally 
flickering out of existence, and
I say goodbye to each word quietly,
thank them for giving me 
some company for a little while, 
and then I wait, their last rites
completed, all that’s left is 
my bitter blue loneliness,
but I know one day, I’ll follow
the words into the sky, beyond 
the stars I see, into a new
galaxy, so I remain content,
atleast they’ll remember me then,
atleast I have something to 
look forward to, even if the
present isn’t the best.
 
 
 
 
 

My soul is hungry for more
love, more offerings of good
faith and sweet promises at
the altar that is my heart, it 
wants what my life has been 
spent reading about, so it
prowls around my body, pushes
and pulls it into situations it’s
not ready for then asks why it
can’t keep up, it doesn’t wait
around, instead rushes to the
closest replica of attraction it
can find, doesn’t savour what it 
has, just wants more and more,
darting from person to person,
hoping affection for one will 
prevail but instead gets stuck in
this vicious cycle- why couldnt
it be content with what it was 
given? Why couldnt I? Instead,
in my search for a better love, 
in my search for a brighter love,
all I did was lose what I had gotten,
until I was left with less and
less, till I landed in this reality,
where even though my soul
still hoped for more, it knew,
I knew, I had nothing.
 

 
 
 
 







let this world crush me/ today, all I have is a bitter blue tongue/ chilled from the lies it’s uttered/ what a change it is/ the world used to be mine/ now it doesn’t even look at me when I pass/ so let it crush me/ churn me/ twist me/ burn me/ let it cut me to my core/ I already know that all that’s left/ is rotten and rancid/ fit for nothing but/ destruction.
















 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
I never realised the small 
forms self harm can take, always
thought in terms of explosions 
instead of flickers, thought of
the monsters that I could see, but
not the monsters shadowing me,
never realised loving myself
was a process, not a decision, and
some days it’s hard. Some
days, I buy a pair of tight jeans 
and vow to shrink until they’re 
loose, I pick at my food seeing 
it only as calories and not as 
energy, I allow myself to be 
a puppet controlled by the
whispers that say I’m too much, 
some days, the small forms of
hurt pile up until this body is 
more wound than skin, more 
bullet holes than flesh, and 
those days, I persevere anyway-
this road was never going
to be easy, I was a fool to think
it would be, a fool to think it could
be, but atleast I’m still on
the right path, atleast I haven’t
been led astray into wilderness.









 
 
I watch my heart flutter
across the room, watch you 
exclaim at the exquisite beauty
of something so naive, watch
it gravitate towards you, watch
you tear apart almost 
scientifically, and now, after
all that, you ask me why we 
don’t talk? Would you talk 
to someone who broke your 
wings, someone who took away
your identity, someone who 
pierced your skin until you
were bled dry of the joy you
used to feel? Sorry. I didn’t 
realise that your power over my
past was supposed to give you
power over my future, sorry, 
I won’t be used anymore.


 
I shouldve known it
wasn’t right when I had nothing 
to write about, should’ve
known the difference between
loneliness and love, should’ve 
known better- so blame me.
Blame me for the poetry I 
spilled across your life, the
intrusion I was, the heartbreak
I still am, I’m ready to 
serve as the sacrifice in this war,
because ever since this 
mistake was put into motion,
my conscience has been a 
siren, so burn me at the altar
of bad lovers, I can already
smell the smoke of my own 
ashes- I am ready for my demise.



 
 

it almost felt alien to me, 
not hearing a whistle as I walked
past a group of boys, not feeling
the heat of a stranger’s glare on 
my back, or more accurately,
my ass, not feeling exposed with
every step I take, not feeling
like meat waiting to be turned
into a meal, not feeling like 
a target, waiting to be shot at.
I had forgotten what this
warm breeze of freedom felt
like, forgotten that I too had
a claim to public spaces, 
forgotten that my identity 
counted as much as theirs did,
but can you blame me? Who
can remember who they are when
in the eyes of the world, they
shapeshifted into a beast to
control centuries ago? Who can
reclaim a freedom they’ve never 
gotten? Who can hear the 
sound of harassment over and
over and over again, and not 
respond to abuse as a mating call?
Who can blame me, when 
something as simple as walking
down the street as a human being
is a luxury that I’ve never been
given? Instead, all I’ve ever
been in this place, is afraid.







 
 
Distance can be a canyon,
a glance stretching miles 
and miles, a sentence creating
a drop so sharp, you’re not sure
when it’ll end, and distance
can be a blessing, each kilometre
providing a sense of peace that
couldn’t be achieved close by,
because distance is versatile, it
changes its stripes with every 
person who uses it as a defense
mechanism, but for me, distance
was just a reassurance that even
5000 kilometres away, my decision
didn’t change, even the distance 
between us, didn’t (and 
hasn’t) made me stop 
thinking about you.



 
 

I tried so hard to fit myself into
this plastic mold, to join this line 
of picture perfect girls with
picture perfect lives, but the cost
of staying was just too high, I 
couldn’t sacrifice my mind at the
altar of high school politics, 
couldn’t dance with the devil 
just to say I danced, so I stayed
outside, wearing the same
wish to belong, only not 
indulging it, only not letting
it consume me till all that’s left
is plastic- I guess standing in a 
room full of pretty girls and
not being pretty isn’t that bad 
when the room will be a fades
memory when the time comes, 
guess I can’t stand thinking
that if I looked back at this
moment, I wouldn’t be able
to find myself.
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

The only constant in my life is the worry,
the sweet taste of self loathing mixed 
with apologies, I haven’t lived a day
for so long in which everything is
low tide calm, instead my
life is full of waves : depression, anxiety, loneliness,
they all come in droves till my metaphors
are mixed up and I see bees in the waves;
hallucinations act like a barrier you see, between
me and the casket of panic 
I’m usually buried in
everytime I do anything- I am half dead
now, lying here with a flower crown
made of sadness, I 
was told my illness was an aesthetic 
a while back, and
I guess I just never quite let go of that, so here
I am, heart stuck in my throat,
body shrinking into itself, still afraid
to change, because
pain has been my style 
for so, so long.














There are 42 hours, or so
I’ve been told, before the world
shrinks to just us, 42 hours 
before beams of blinding clarity
pierce the veil we’ve been hiding
under, and I wish I could deny
what I’ve been thinking about,
but the truth is imprinted on my
skin everytime someone 
mentions your name, even my
heart has been discarding
reality as long as it doesn’t
contain you, so for the next 42
hours, I guess I’ll just 
stare at the clock, urging it
to speed up, until I get to 
finally look at you instead.




 
 
I value my sleep more than
I value most things, I hoard it
like a dragon with its gems,
and I’ve never quite mastered 
the art of staying awake until
the darkness turns into dawn, 
because my productivity wanes
and waxes like the moon, and
most nights I can barely lift my 
head, and I wonder what that
says about you, because it’s
later than it should be, and 
my mind is still thinking about 
you, I wonder what this sacrifice
truly means, because it’s
later than it should be, but
as long as you’re awake, I 
seem to be willing to give it 
all up, like I am a dragon so 
smitten, I gave away my jewels.

 
All my life, I’ve been hesitant 
at best, terrified at worst of
new things, because with every
change I imagine myself crumbling
under the glares of the people
who must watch me make a fool
of myself, and all my life,
I’ve been unable to initiate things, 
like I was(am) a doll incapable
of the simplest things, like I 
was a small dog, running away at
the slightest hint of afresh, and 
the truth is habits don’t change 
overnight, I can’t wake up and
suddenly begin to live the way I 
want to, but if under the 
cover of darkness you decide 
to set up an initiation, I guess
I wouldn’t mind, no I
wouldn’t mind at all.
 
 
 
 
I sit alone in this crooked room
 
watch it expand and contract 
with my life, like it’s breathing and
its lungs are powered by my 
moods- like when I’m happy, the
room can contain the entire world,
swaying to the rhythm of the music
that beats in my chest, and
when I’m sad, the room doesn’t
have enough space for anything
worthwhile, so I sit alone, I 
sit alone and hope for a day when 
I can look past the room into
the world again.







 
 
 

Whenever we speak, the words
scarcely leave my mouth before 
you tear them apart, because in
the world you live in, everything
sounds smarter in a deeper voice,
everything makes sense when 
it’s wearing a suit and tie, so 
you stomp on whatever I say, 
replace it with the same words,
tell yourself that you did me 
a favour by cutting me off, like
suffocating someone can be 
justified, like you would listen to
me if I made sense, when the truth
is as long as I inhabit this body,
you’ll continue to invade my
sentences, continue making 
me smaller with every sentence
of mine you discard- don’t you 
see you’re? fulfilling your own 
prophecy, don’t you see the
notion of supremacy you’re
perpetuating? Maybe you do. 
Maybe every explanation you think
I need, every explanation you give
without me asking is a bullet 
aimed at my head, trying to 
make me stagger, make me fall,
make me complicit in my own 
defeat, but I won’t fall. I won’t
vanish underneath your cloud
of condescension, won’t back 
down just so you can add me to
the list of girls you thought you
ran over, no, I’ll push back, and
when I do, I hope you can get
used to hearing a voice
which isn’t your own.






My heart sounds like a downpour 
on a summer afternoon every time
I talk to you, it hits the pavement 
like droplets do, shattering on 
impact, but I don’t care- everything
valuable to me is fragile and if
my heart needs to break, I don’t
mind if you’re the one holding 
the hammer, don’t mind if you 
change your mind, because I 
haven’t felt my heart beat so fast 
in a while, and I’ll do anything to
make it keep going, guess 
this love is a passion project, one
that I’ve been working on for 
last four months, one that might 
end up in a closet somewhere 
gathering dust, but until then, it’s
the best decision I’ve ever made.


 

All my life, the most exciting
thing about me has been my weight.
People look at me and congratulate
me on my genes, congratulate me on being
skinny, on having a body that 
everyone wants to have, they tell me
to be careful because ‘putting on
weight is easy you know, and you don’t 
want to be that girl’, but the truth
is, my body is sharp enough to cut the soul
residing inside it, my collarbones
prick me at night, my skeletal hands are only
capable of shaking, my body is only
worthwhile because I know if I sold it, there 
would be buyers. All my life, the
most exciting thing about me has been
my weight, my angles transformed into
a label that has been sewn through
my skin, the needle leaving small drops
of blood on my back, so is it any 
wonder that I can’t eat without thinking 
of where those calories will go? 
Is it even a surprise that I only feel pretty when
I feel like I’m breaking? This 
body has been my shelter, my home, my
own, but most days it feels like
a publicity stunt, so I smile. I smile and tell
people not to diet, smile and tell people
how lucky I am to be so thin, smile
and try my hardest to forget this cage
that I can’t escape- I smile, but
I still don’t ask, still will never ask for 
a second helping.





 
 

 
 
I fall into the same trap every time
like a circus animal, I repeat the
same tricks for different crowds
at the behest of someone else, and
I never quite understood where it
all went wrong, only that I would 
rather gnaw off my own leg than
believe these silky sweet lies, rather
die stuck in the same cycle that
I was trying to escape, than 
become a pawn in your game,
because the truth is that no matter
how hard I try, my own naivety 
draws me back in, my own 
foolishness makes me fall in love
with the same faults that made 
me leave, and most days I try
to run away from this life the
destinies plotted for me, but most
days, I don’t succeed. So instead,
I walk into the trap these days,
knowing fully well I could be
maimed, and I sit there patiently,
waiting to finally meet my
hunter, waiting to finally strike.










 
 

 
 
Makeup mostly seemed like
A distant thing to me, a 
wild bear that needed to be
shunned, a growling wolf just
waiting to tear me apart until
all that was left of me was my
body, until frivolity was the 
only word that described me-
I just didn’t want to be a cliché,
so I preached power in 
masculinity, remained enshrined
in the tomb of patriarchy, 
praying to the gods of social
norms, and my feminism was
a safe yet fragile concept, one
that ignored the intersectionality
of problems, one that ignored
the complexity of the seemingly
frivolous until one day I found 
myself with kajal in my hand, 
fingers trembling as I applied 
it myself, heart thumping as I 
tackled my own sexist standpoint
and reclaimed the joy that 
many people feel, reclaimed
the power of a brush for the
art that is my face- I 
applied the kajal, and the first
thing i realised was how
good I could feel, free from
the shackles of learned 
negativity, free from the shackles
of my own toxicity.





 
 

 
 
My legs are molten lead today,
they can barely keep me upright
and my heart is thumping so 
loud, I’m scared you can hear it
on the other side of town, 
and my hands are shaking
like they’ve forgotten what 
they were meant for, so I 
step out of my body, watch 
it dissociate till my muscles are
simply pulp and my bones are
ground to dust- exhaustion has
droven my weary mind insane, 
until all I can think of is melting,
of being smaller until I 
disappear and all these 
responsibilities flicker out of
existence, until everyone has
forgotten about the space I 
occupied because today, my
legs are molten lead barely 
keeping me upright and I just
need time to escape, just need
time to recuperate.












 
 

 
 
My sins burn as bright
as the sun on most days,
like an aura around me
it grows everytime I 
make a mistake, and 
my sins burn as hot as
the sun does, they have
left marks on my flesh that
most can’t see but 
I feel everytime I move
a muscle, and I wonder
what that says about me, 
that pain feels like a second
skin but I don’t remember
the last time I felt 
comfortable, wonder what
It says about me, that 
I nurture my faults like they
arent weeds, that I grew a 
garden of thorns and then
blame them for being too
prickly- guess it says that 
I was afraid. Guess it
means that my faults were
Never the one casting the 
aura, it was my insecurity,
hoping no one would get 
close enough to see that
behind these thorns are
a myriad of colours, that
behind these walls, the
home isn’t all bad, guess
this was never about my
sins after all, it was about 
me, trying to be as aloof as
the sun, trying not to 
get burnt by anyone else, 
only to realise, it was too
late to save me, to save 
my soul, my life
from my own fire.



 

So I’m back to the first love,
The one that ended 
So long back, I had
Forgotten why it started,
Forgotten how talking to
You made me stay up the 
Entire night, forgot how you
reminded me of shooting 
Stars, because everytime 
I saw one I would wish for 
You, I’m back to the same
love, only it’s been a 
While, it’s grown since it
Last stood at my door,
But it still makes me feel
The same way- first loves 
were never supposed to be
The only love, but I guess
Love that feels like this
doesnt need to
Follow the rules.



 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
We made shrinking into 
an artform a while back, a game 
of who could eat the most 
yet take up the least space, 
we exchanged trade secrets over
group lunches where we all
declined second helpings;
It was always the polite thing
to do. A kindness in the
form of self harm, in the 
form of group harm, in the
form of mob mentality- only we
didn’t realise the only house
we were burning were our 
own bodies. Later,
when the smoke alarms 
finally began to sound, we just
congratulated each other- our
butterfly bodies were too weak 
to fly but atleast we were small,
atleast we were finally fitting
into the clothes we had 
only dreamed of buying.
A few weeks ago, I met an
old friend at a party, and a man
told us we were looking a bit 
on the chubby side, so
my friend said ‘thank you’ and
I said ‘I’m sorry’ and I wonder 
what that says about me, that
even after all this time, my body
is still one that’s only acceptable
to me when it’s dying, only 
acceptable to me when it’s
acceptable to me when it’s
acceptable to everyone else.





 
 

I used to want to cut through 
my past until every memory of you 
was erased, I wanted
to undo the mistakes I made so 
that I could make them in
another time,
another place, but
sometimes repetition doesn’t
mean fickle, sometimes
repetition just means realisation,
and I guess I was foolish then,
foolish now, because I’ve 
always believed in doing what
you love until it’s made mostly
of memories , so why shouldn’t 
I feel the same about you?
You see, I remember all the
birthdays, the songs, the trips,
I remember the almost fights and
the missteps, the awkward 
shift from something to nothing,
and I guess I don’t want to go
back to nothing just to
perpetuate a code that never
was more than a sham, a farce,
a misstep, you see,
you know what my favourite 
flavour of icecream is and why
I can’t bear smoke, and I know
things about you that you never
thought you could utter aloud, 
and our lives have been so 
intertwined, I’m not sure what 
a sunset looks like if you’re not
witnessing it too, not sure 
what to watch when I can’t
see you, not sure what to read 
when you’re not reading it too, 
you see, I wanted to cut through 
my past and remove all my
memories of you, and I still do,
but only to make a scrapbook
out of them, because something
about you is just too
special not to keep around.




 
 

I watched you dissociate with the
detached curiousity of someone
who Doesn’t Get It, I stood near
you, waited till you were on fire before
considering to offer some
inadequate help, and I saw you
falter with every step and stayed
silent- I’m that Bystander every
movie loves to loathe, that
pretentious nice person who’s 
sickly more than sweet, who’s
dusk more than dawn, lie more
than truth, and I’m sorry. 
Sorry that I watched you hoist 
the world to your shoulders, sorry
that I let you believe you could do
a better job than Atlas, sorry 
I just watched you falter 
falter 
falter
till the world broke down around
us, but mostly I’m sorry
that now that you’re not here,
someone else has to pick
up the pieces, distribute the blame 
like gum in a school hallway, 
designate responsibility like
a sergeant  in an army, make 
people like me, fickle and scared,
confess to their part in the
murder of the mind, 
mostly I’m sorry that I’m 
the new Brave One, mostly
I’m sorry that I have to shoulder
the same burden I’ve 
feen so many collapse under,
mostly, I’m selfish and 
still the same person trying
to walk away from a crime scene,
trying to just live,
trying to hide from my conscience,
tying to not to be the hero.



 

My body has always been a bit too small
for my flighty spirit, so most days
it feels like a cage.
I rattle its bars sometimes, in a foolish
bid to free myself, but all it
results in is bone
chilling exhaustion, all
I’m left with is the knowledge of
my  crushing failure.
I liked to pretend I was a bird
soaring through the sky, with no
words melting in my mouth,
with no thoughts threatening to douse
their creator in gasoline,
I liked to pretend I was free.
But the truth is I’m a puppet like
any other, just another person
dangling from strings,
slowly suffocating;
my body has always been a bit too small
for my flighty spirit, so most days
it feels like a cage.
I used to rattle its bars sometimes,
but now I just sit and wait
for my face to turn blue, for
this world to become a blur, for
me to suffocate.










Sometimes existing feels like/ holding my own head under water/ trying to breathe/ but/ drowning instead/ sometimes/ existing feels like choosing to be shot at/ when/ I could have just swallowed some pills/ sometimes/ existing just seems like/ the harder option
























 

I’m sick of my mind, sick of
its inability to let me live, sick of
the worry that envelopes it, the
panic that chains it, I’m sick 
of me, sick of dreaming of
cutting myself, sick of trying
to make myself smaller, sick
of shaking hands and a 
good for nothing body, I’m sick
of this life, it fits like a shirt 
that shrunk in the wash, which
is to say, I can’t fit into it 
without ripping it, and so I’m 
sick of it, sick of calling myself
a poet but being unable to 
write, sick of trying to be good
at things, and failing, I’m sick
of thinking so much. All I 
want is for my mind to fall silent,
for the incessant demons to 
cease their talk for a minute,
all I want is to be able to breathe
without feeling like I’m drowning.
All I want is to feel calm, instead
all I feel is high tide panic, all
I see are the waves, preparing
to overwhelm me.












I’ve lost count now, lost count
of the number of times I’ve looked
at you and smiled, of the number
of times you said something
and my heart dropped seven
stories down, lost count of
how many times I’ve wanted to
kiss you, wanted to hold you,
wanted to be near you, guess
this love is no longer quantifiable,
and that’s okay, because even
as the numbers elude me,
you stay- In my head, memories
with you bloom so often now,
it feels like spring even in this
parched weather, and I guess 
that’s how I feel about you, like
you’re a pleasant reminder that
this life, this life is not all bad.


So a pair of too tight jeans fit
me perfectly now, and I see it 
as a metaphor for growth. 
See it as a metaphor for
evolution, when truly it’s just 
me going backwards, me
shrinking, me falling into 
a pattern that’s more dangerous
than I even know. Guess it’s
a metaphor for being unhealthy, but
my butterfly body doesn’t care,
it’s too afraid to fly so it lets
it’s wings droop, frail from 
disuse, and I don’t eat- let 
this be a metaphor for peeling
away my skin like I’m a fruit, for
shaving my soul just to make it
weigh a little less, let this be 
a metaphor for fading away.


 
 

I had stopped seeing poetry 
in everything a long time back
Stopped seeing words floating 
mid air when I walked down the
street, stopped feeling excited
when I looked at the sky.
Before, everything used to
be a poem waiting to happen, 
until nothing was, until
I forgot what I was writing about.
And I know I’m just a cliché
surviving on unrealistic
romantic ideals, and I know 
there are no princes in real
life, but everytime I look
at you I see a poem waiting 
to happen. I have been mapping
out your gestures for far
longer than I realised, and 
I’ve been running out of
syllables every time I look at
you- I had almost forgotten 
what poetry looked like when
it could breathe. when it could
keep me awake at 2am, when
it laughed and smiled- I had almost
forgotten what poetry looked
like, till I looked at you.













 
 
 
 
You. You
Should’ve never
Done what you did.
You used to feel like a
Cry for help at first, until
You felt like a car crash- you
Brought my life to an abrupt halt
And you still haven’t apologized for it,
Maybe I should be the one apologizing, apologizing
For this myriad of delusions, these mighty
Expectations that you obviously find
Ridiculous. I guess you thought
I would just move on, like
You never did what you
Did, like you didn’t
Say what you
Said; I guess
You were
Wrong.


 
This entire week, I’ve
been holding knives against my wrist
daring myself to make a cut.
This entire week, I’ve 
been staring at my reflection, wondering 
when it’ll change it to something better.
This entire week, I’ve
been telling myself pretty lies,
but I never quite managed to swallow them.
This entire week, I’ve 
been waiting for a sign that 
I’m better than I think I am, but
this entire week has passed,
and I’m still seeing in shades of blue.







 

 
 
 
 
Four years later, 
I still walk into this home 
expecting you to be here.
Four years later, 
and I still shake everytime 
I see a cigarette or hear a cough.
Four years later, 
I don’t even know whether 
I can trust my memories of you
because
It’s been four years, and 
I still remember how I found out,
still remember what I wore to
the funeral, still remember the
book I was reading, still
remember trying not to cry
trying not to cry
trying not to cry- I
remember the car I went in. 
Remember seeing my friend
outside my house, wondering 
if his shock mirrored my own, and
I still remember every
single
second 
of that day
but I can barely remember your voice.
I barely remember you, 
barely remember anything- 
what we talked about, what you 
teased me about, what
made me know that as long 
As you were around, I was safe;
I just don’t remember anymore.
And I’m not sure how to.
Not sure how to
keep what little I have of you
from disappearing.




 

 
 
She asked me if I really liked 
you, and I didn’t even try to
deny it, because what’s the point 
of denying something that’s inked 
on every single part of 
me? What’s the point of denying 
something that I write about too 
much anyway? What’s the point of 
hiding from these feelings when it’s
obvious they’re persistent as 
hell (patiently knocking on my 
heart no matter how many times 
I tell them I don’t want them, I 
don’t want you), and she asks me if 
I’ll stick around long enough to 
give you a shot and I say I 
still don’t know. I say my heart is 
fickle and mostly frozen, and
I’m not sure it can thaw in just
four months. She says, yes but it’s been 
four years of waiting for you to 
come full circle, waiting for you
to find your way back to him, but
I tell her just because we love 
each other doesn’t mean it works,
or that I’m any different. 
Doesn’t mean I’m any better.








 

 
 
 
 
I never understood why you liked me. 
You’re the kind of person who enters
a room in a bid to light it up, while I like to
sit in the dark, shying away from any 
kind of spotlight, and you speak with the
ease of someone who’s seen enough to 
understand how conversation goes while
I stutter and stammer, getting tongue 
tied about the simplest of things; why did
you choose me? How did you decide
that the best companion of them all was
someone who is barely keeping it together?
Or is the truth just that you don’t know?


I like to think of us as something that’s 
never truly been shattered but that’s a lie-
the cracks of our past still prick me now and
then. I like to think of you as an integral
part of my life, but you were drowning 
and I didn’t even realise, didn’t even flinch.
So maybe the truth is much simpler than
a convoluted reason for this crush, maybe
the truth is one that you still haven’t found out;
crazy looks best in small doses after all,
so who am I to question this infatuation
when the truth is you don’t even know 
what you’re getting into.









 
 
I’m sorry if I’m hard to handle. I’m sorry if you thought you were getting to know a different person, one who wasn’t so anxious or worried, one who behaved like this only sometimes, only in a bid to be endearing-
Sorry if you thought this was an play I was putting on; Sorry if you thought I was just another girl acting like she needed a saviour, but that was never my intention.
The truth is some days every bone in my body aches and creaks like a house lived in too long, and some days I can almost see myself being stuck in this town for another fifteen years and not changing at all, but instead having my personality preserved in stone; I’m not sure what to do.
I’m just not that glad to be alive in this body, not that glad to be alive at this time, in this place, around these people; I’m slowly dissolving. So I’m sorry if this is not what you signed up for, sorry if you were expecting a better deal, because so was I.
And that’s why I’m apologising, because I understand the disappointment you carry; I’ve been carrying it my whole life. Now, I’m just ready to be a different version of myself.











 
 
 
 
 
Instead of writing about you, 
I write about everything else.
I circle my feelings for you like
they’re a chalk outline of a body
at a crime scene, and I gaze at
you like somewhere in your face 
I’ll find the answer to the puzzle
I’m feeling, but I never do.
So instead of writing another 
poem about not being able to 
understand what I want, I write 
about everything else I 
possibly can- I’m just
not ready to analyse this 
crime scene. I’m just not
prepared to follow this chalk
trail to the person I know it’ll
lead back to: you. you. you.



 
We love like it’s in fashion, like
a relationship is on discount 
this season, like romance is
a perfume we’ve worn so
long, its smell is a part of us,
like having another half is 
no longer special- it’s muscle memory. 
And I know I shouldn’t 
say this but maybe that’s what 
we’re doing; we treat this relationship 
like a rented garment,
slipping it on when we need it,
returning it the next morning-
and I’m not sure how much 
longer this will last, because 
at the end of the night, none  
of us are thinking of each other,
we’re just thinking of our next buy.



 
 
 
When the writer gets written about,
 
she feels like someone special.
 
She looks at herself, for once,
 
and doesn't flinch, doesn't look
 
away, doesn't feel useless.
 
When the writer gets written about,
 
she finally understands. All
 
the compliments she used to 
 
receive never quite reached her,
 
but when she gets written about,
 
she understands, almost like she
 
was surrounded by people
 
speaking a different language,
 
but you found a way to translate,
 
almost like she was adrift,
 
but you were a harbor- like
 
she was a puzzle, and you
 
finally solved her.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sometimes family sounds a lot like screaming.
like a group of people brought up
too harsh
too worried 
too loud
like a group of people who somewhere,
somehow, 
forgot how to coexist.
Sometimes family sounds like embers,
too tired to burn.
We wait for a spark to set us alive, but
when it arrives we realise
that setting ourselves on fire 
never helps.
Instead, we just burn till we
can’t anymore.
Too exhausted to change.




 
When I’m around you, I want to speak in pauses. Mostly because I want to emphasize how the world seems to stop tilting, or falling, or whatever you want to imagine it does when I see you. I mean, when I’m around you, all I can do is hear your voice.
I know, I know, it sounds crazy. But it’s the truth. It’s like for a second, my world shrinks till it contains just you, smiling at me. 
And I know, every time you look at me means nothing now, and everytime you talk to me means nothing now, but I wish it did. 
I just wish I could travel back to the past. I wish we could be on the same page, on the same line, on the same book.
But you haven’t read a book for four years, and I can’t blame you. I wouldn’t do something that reminded me of me either, but I just wish you did.
I wish you did.











 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The apologies you give me seem
fragile (like your ego), they’re little
glass whispers ready to crack 
on contact, ready to make me 
bleed. They melt bitterly on my
tongue and now every word I say
is tinged with a bit of venom, with
a bit of you- I’m not sure how
much longer I can do is. I’m not 
how much longer I can be this
version of myself. My frustrations
blooms larger than your sins, your
apologies shadow every word I say
and now, now we’re stuck in this 
limbo, just like a glitch in time none
of us know how to escape. The 
apologies you used to give me 
are lingering behind me like 
they’re just waiting to pounce on
me, like they’re just waiting for
me to confess how guilty I feel, and
right now, I just want to escape 
from them. I just want to leave 
behind these honeysuckle words,
leave behind these venomous 
glares- carrying your personality 
around is weighing on my
shoulders; I’m not sure how much
longer I can stay upright.







?
 
The night sky seems to almost fold in on itself till it bleeds hue’s so dark they contain every colour,
and as I sit and stare at this messy stain of a sky, it nearly seems to acknowledge my presence by showering me with droplets of rain.
I never thought I would be here, sitting in the middle of this withered garden, sitting and watching the sky bleed as it whimpers at me, as it makes me complicit in its dark thoughts; I feel so small. 
Who am I compared to the world around me? Who am I to even be compared?
So instead of trying to wrap my head around how little I truly matter,or trying to understand how large everything around me is, I just sit.
I sit, and absorb the air like its something I’ve never felt before, like the world isn’t the same one I shrink from every single day- I guess that’s one way to look at the night sky.
Like at night our world slowly shrinks till it just contains us, like at night, everything is magical and every raindrop that hits our face isn’t just normal, it’s an occurrence. 
It’s a whisper. It’s a battlecry of vulnerability.
So as I sit there, I don’t do anything.
I just bask in the strangeness of the night, I just bask as the sky  weeps around me- I just sit.
I just sit. 







?
 
 
I wear my vulnerability like a knife
I’m crying my eyes out
on stairways, I’m constantly in a state of strife,
I’m drowning, drowning in this pool of doubt
and I wish you could come back.
You were the loudest feeling I have ever seen,
and now I’m left feeling like an amnesiac,
waving a knife around, crying till I feel clean,
building my soft into an armor,
building my voice into a disguise;
I’m still hiding from us- you were a charmer 
and I loved you, but you’ll be my demise
so here I am- wearing my vulnerability as
a knife, my softness as a disguise, slowly
morphing into someone who has
never known your eyes, someone who’s so pious, her holy
heart would never catch your eye, yes
I have changed- I’m so soft now that I’ll never know your caress,
I’ll never again be in this mess, 
I’m so soft now- I’ll never feel distress.

 
I’m not in love with you. 
Atleast, I’m not in love with
the kindness you give away like 
it costs nothing, not
in love with your bashful 
smile when you catch
someone looking, not in love
with the way you feel a 
little bit like home; I’m not 
in love with you.
But sometimes, I get a bit
dizzy when I look at you,
thinking of all the 
possibilities we’ve always 
had, that I’ve always
discarded, sometimes I feel
a bit at ease when I talk
to you, like just for a second
the sky isn’t falling anymore,
but I’m not in love with you.
No, not at all.
 
 

THINGS I LEARNT IN 2016:
1. Love isn’t always larger than life.
Sometimes, it’s quiet,
A whisper that lasts for a second,
for a week.
Love is sometimes infatuation, 
sometimes a thrill that lasts for just a while, and then
Love ends, but it
doesn’t make excuses, instead it 
accepts the truth with
sad smile and
walks away.
2. Being true to yourself feels
better than you ever thought it would, and
even when it pricks, and even
when it hurts, it’s 
better than living in a cage, no matter
How beautiful it is.
3. There are some problems you
can’t solve, and it’ll
feel like a gaping wound in the fabric
of your life; you’ll wonder how 
you went from feeling on top of the world, to 
being smaller than you could’ve imagined, 
but then you’ll realise you don’t have to
sit in a closet full of other people’s skeletons,
too scared to breathe;
instead you can watch as people you love finally
find the strength to cast away
the ashes of their own monsters.
4. Time flows like a river in flood,
rushing over  everything in its
path, and just when you
find your footing, time will
pull the rug from under you, 
and you’ll be left on your back, wondering
how you could’ve ever thought
the calm would’ve lasted.



?
 
Everything seems to be closing in on me and
I just want to scream. 
I guess it was my fault, I guess I should’ve realised in a place like this 
nothing can remain soft, nothing can remain quiet, nothing can remain private.
I wish it could.
I wish we could escape all these gazes;
They are burning through my skin,
and I wish we could run away from all these expectations people have of us, because now,
everything is closing in on me and 
I just want to scream. 
Yesterday, I gathered up my thoughts like a long skirt and ran without abandon;
Today I am tripping over myself in a foolish bid to back away.









?
 
 
Sometimes I want to take those three months back, because if
they hadn’t happened then, maybe they could have happened now;
maybe we could have stayed up all night, with me listening to your voice and you, letting me pretend it meant nothing; maybe
I wouldn’t be writing this; like a lover pining over the already lost;
I mean, you told me that you got  drunk that one day, and all I could muster up was a weak murmur of disapproval. 
I mean, I’ve been sitting on this bed all night, and thinking about you as if that chapter hadn’t already been written, 
I mean, why can’t I edit my own life? 
Take those months, take that paragraph and paste it in the present instead.
Take this feeling and build the world I had then around it.
See, every corner of my house reminds me of a conversation we’ve had, and every book I read seems to hold a hint of you, and
it doesn’t even matter because I already wrote that chapter and there’s no place in this novel for repetition, 
especially when the story will end the same way.







 

 
 
 
 
So, I’m
back to the first love, 
back to same person who stood
strong through it all, back to 
feelings like this;
pastel sky, 
shining sun,
morning haze.
And this love, it doesn’t 
feel worn, doesn’t feel wrong, 
instead, it fits
like my favourite green sweater;
there’s enough of it
for me to feel comfortable, not
enough for me
to forget who owns it, not
enough to make me
forget the baggage that came with it,
but, right now,
the baggage doesn’t matter, since
I’m back to the first love, 
back to the
person who always 
felt a little bit like home.










 

 
 
 
 
 
 
I can’t believe you don’t
see it, I can’t believe
you don’t care; what was the
point of these last few months?
what was the point of all
the poetry, the talks
we had in the middle
of the night, did you care
at all then? Or was it
just an elaborate
game, a foolish pastime?
Don’t you see, what we have
is too good to leave in
in the past, it’s too good
to say goodbye- yet here
we are. You, leaving me
behind without even
an explanation; I
guess I’m lucky, because
If you don’t know how good
what we have now is, you’ll
probably never know.
I guess I’m lucky, that
you were fickle and rude,
I guess you are not too
good to say goodbye to.









 

 
 
 
 
 
 
I am lying here, a subtle caress
away from losing
any faith I had in myself,
and I’m a whisper
away from giving up- I am
not brave when I’m with them.
I only speak my
mind when I know everyone
will agree with me, and
when I know that it
won’t end like this, like me
being a wreck on the
floor, and I ignore
my ideals when convenient-
courage only tastes good
when it’s sampled with
kindness, when it’s mixed
with being agreeable,
when it defies prejudice
in the most privileged
way possible; I am not
brave when I’m with them.
I’m just what they expect
me to be, even my arguments
are ones that sit
comfortably on their bias, and
even my rebelliousness
is something that’s worn
by so many people before me,
it slipped into the status quo,
and now, now I know that
everything I do is done
with the caution of someone
with nothing to lose except
their privilege, except
their comfortable existence,
except their claim to an
injustice they’ve never felt.






 

What happens when we 
stop being art? 
What happens when
everything I’ve
written about you looks 
like scrawled
gibberish, and what happens
when it’s only
in my eyes? What happens
when I’m tired of
this project, ready to move
on to the next,
ready to forget this
happened? What happens 
when it’s my fault?
What happens when we 
slowly fade out
of existence, till it’s
just you and
me, just two people who
knew each other? 
What happens when this 
stops looking 
amazing? What happens 
when I just want 
this to disappear, I just
want us to
return to the way we were?
What happens 
when I think this looks like
nostalgia, but to
you, it’s still the present?






 
 

 
 
We dress up every please
in evening clothes-
say pretty please, say
please with a cherry on top,
say please in pearls, in 
high heels, in a carefully
contoured face; what’s
the point of sickly 
sweetness when its not
done right? We say please
like its casual change, like
it’s weekday trash, tossed 
out on the street on your
way to work, on your way
to more meaningful
words- we say please
like time is wind blowing
in the opposite direction.
And please doesn’t mind,
please is happy to walk
barefoot through these
burning roads, begging 
for pity from anyone
who would listen, and
please is happy to wear 
that lace dress, that lipstick
and slowly, steadily
break down your barriers
with that smirk- so say 
please. Say pretty please, 
say pretty please with a
cherry on top and let it
slowly, steadily get 
what you want.




?
 
 
 
 
 
Independence tasted bitter 
at first, like something that
wasn’t quite ready to be eaten,
but the taste grew on me, and
now I quite enjoy the sharp
tang of looking out for myself,
coupled with a sweet aftertaste
of victory, of climbing a mountain
I thought I couldn’t scale.
















 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The thing about blame is that it’s insidious. 

It snakes through your body and buries itself in your bones till every step you take is heavier-filled with rage and bitterness. You arm yourself with self righteousness and grief till you’re impenetrable; a shadow of the person you once were, consumed by the flames of your supposedly just accusation.
The thing about blaming yourself is that it’s worse. You can’t vow to take revenge or bloat with self righteousness. Instead, there’s a quiet hatred for yourself enveloping your body till you can barely breathe. 
And honestly, it doesn’t help. You can hate yourself till Kingdom come, and you can weigh yourself down with guilt, but it won’t help. You’ll never feel better about it. You’ll be filled with self reproach and it’ll just be a shadow following you around, till you’re a shell of the person you once were.
That’s why it’s not worth it. It’s been three years of beating myself up over something I wouldn’t have been able to control, and every day was a battle, till it wasn’t and slowly it faded to once a week, and then once a month, till the present where it’s just something that hits me every now and then.
And everytime it does, I just tell myself it wasn’t my fault, that I couldn’t have done anything, that it would’ve happened regardless of my actions. At first this didn’t help at all, but little by little you understand, and you agree, and you imbibe what you’ve been trying to tell yourself till you reach a point where you can look at yourself and not cringe. 
I’m not sure I’m there yet. But my point is, there is an end. There is a point where you make peace with whatever it is you blame yourself for. There is a point where you realise your limitation and you realise you can’t change the past. This is when you’ll be able to accept yourself. And it might sound cliché, but it’s true. It has to be.




?
 
 
 
 
 
A change is gonna come. 
Itll be just a rustle at first, just
a whisper of something far greater,
and then it’ll billow, billow into 
the something far bigger than
someone like me l, or you), but
none of us will mind, because
a change is gonna come, and
we’ll be standing here (still
young, still rebellious) and,
we’ll be waiting for it.









?

 
 
 
 
I’ve been stuck in this 
quicksand for 
a while now, and
ever so slowly
I’m sinking. 
Sinking, like a boat 
with holes
in its hull; water is 
rushing in and there is 
nothing I 
can do to stop it, nothing
I can do 
to stop this blue 
sky from folding 
and 
enveloping me. 
I was made to wreck.
I was made to 
slowly shatter like a 
crystal lake, made
to ruin
everything,
made to self destruct.
There is nothing
I can do to 
stop the moon from 
mocking me, to
stop the
sun from glaring 
at me- to
stop you from
coming too 
close;
I was made to wreck.





 
 
You occupy my 
thoughts more frequently these days;
But I don’t mind much.
I think about you 
in clouds and stars- you flow through
my head like a storm.
I don’t mind it much.
I don’t mind thinking about
your hands holding mine.
And I don’t mind you
punctuating my thoughts; it’s 
like roses blooming.
Lately, I’ve been caught 
up in my head more often.
But I don’t mind much.





?

 
 
I buy notebooks and fill them
with traces of your
vivid dreams, and
I buy notebooks just to write
your name in them, just
to hold them close when
I can’t hold you. 
I write in whispers these days-
silently. 
Stealthily.
Your body is a house I wrecked
a while back, but 
I still want it back.
I sneak in sometimes (when
you aren’t around) and
watch it 
slowly,
sneakily dissociate. You hide 
your love from
yourself: blame me. 
You carve yourself up: blame
me. You scream and watch
yourself bleed: blame it
all on me,
I don’t mind being the 
proxy between you and your
body, I don’t mind being the thing
you mistakenly
attribute your hurt to. 
I buy notebooks even now.
Fill them up
with traces of you.
Traces of your lips, lingering
on mine. 
I hold them close,
because
I can’t hold you.


 
 

 
 
Everything around me is bright, and
I’m squinting just to survive; 
everything around me is happy 
and I’m withdrawing further into
myself at every chance I get- I 
just want to live. I just want to
dance and be able to see the 
same sun everyone else is, not 
the one that’s tinged red, thats
tinged anger, that’s tinged bitter.
What will it take to make myself
whole? Today I stood on 
someone’s chest, but I was the one
who couldn’t breathe. Who wouldn’t
breathe. Is there even any 
between the two anymore? A boy
once told me that if I wanted to
write, I first needed to experience
things, I first needed to ‘shed some
blood’; Now I’m bleeding and I 
just want to fix myself. I just
want to breathe. I just want 
to be calm. calm. calm.


















?
 
 
 
 
Pieces of me 
lie in splinters on
this dusty 
ground- nobody
has made
an effort to erase
my remnants 
from this floor. Yet. 
The key to 
self harm lies in knowing
how to hide it,
in knowing that nobody 
looks at a
supposedly happy person’s 
arms. Or legs. 
Nobody checks a pious 
brat’s veins for 
drugs- this world is about 
appearances. Not
reality. Pieces of me have 
laid here
since last Wednesday and
I don’t blame 
anyone. Why would they want
to come near 
my filthy personality when I can’t 
stand it myself?














?
 
 
 
 
I don’t know what to compare
you to anymore- all I can think of
is how you’re slipping through
my hands quicker than I can 
catch you, how you’re disappearing
like the wind racing across the 
world, how you’re flying away- and 
there’s nothing I can do about it.






























 
 

 
 
 
 
 
Take a dash of callousness, pair
it with a bit of self righteousness
and add a spoonful of ego, a cup
of stupidity, maybe even some
sprinkles of ignorance, cowardice
and idiocy; that’s all it takes to
build someone like you now days.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Callousness
I had forgotten what it felt like to
fade, to dissipate into the wind and
I guess you forgetting showed me 
how that feels again. How it feels
to be slowly left in the dust, to 
be of the utmost unimportance- 
This is what it feels like to be 
forgotten. It feels like waking up
at 2am and realising that you 
still hadn’t remembered, it feels 
like dull throb of doubt about
every conversation we’ve ever
had, it feels like being invisible. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Self righteousness, cowardice, ego
Every word you said buried you
deeper into the ground but 
funnily enough, I could feel the 
dirt at my neck- I’m not sure
what this metaphor means, maybe
something about how you lied to
me just to salvage what was left 
of your pride and now I’m the 
one that feels left for dead, maybe
something about you dragging 
me into a grave just to hide your
mistakes, maybe something about
how you just refused to own up.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stupidity, ignorance, idiocy
I’m not even sure how to react
to this wreck- how does someone
like you create a mess like this?
The problem is not one but three,
the mistake is not one but many,
and you are just incorrigible. If
I put your forgetfulness down to 
stupidity, would I be lying to
myself? Would I be ignoring the
actual cause, would I just end 
up succumbing to my idiocy like
I believed you did?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You
I still can’t believe that you forgot,
that you tried to hide your 
mistake, that you forgot, that you
forgot, that you forgot. The 
word almost trails after me now, 
taunting me with your name, 
taunting me with reminders of
your blunder, taunting me with 
you. You. You. What happened
to all the conversations we had?
What happened to you actually 
being here? I guess I’ve forgotten 
why I’m still sticking around, I
guess this is my cue to make 
a mistake, and blame it on my
foolishness. You. You. You-
you forgot, and I should’ve known
you would. I should’ve known.








I’ve been collecting disappointments for
longer than I can remember- if this
sadness was a currency, I would be
richer than you can imagine. The thing
is, people like me are thinking about
things too little for other people to
worry about. The thing is, I feel much
heavier than a fragile thing like me
has the right to, the thing is, the glass is
empty and there’s no way to look at it
positively anymore- what am I
suppose to do now? My bank is almost
overflowing with guilt and regret, and
it’s almost pooling at my feet- I am
ankle deep in my own bitterness and
I’m not sure how to step out of it. So
tell me, what do I do if my mind is
in tatters? I feel like atlas, only
I can’t take all the weight- my
shoulders are
popping out of their sockets, my head is
spinning and my little collection of
angry is doing no good, how do I
help myself? How do I make order out
of chaos, method out of madness, and
kindness out of sadness? If I let go
will I be able to survive? Or will
I just fall to my death with only my
disappointment keeping me company?
How do I survive myself and the world
around me without tearing my muscles
apart? Right now, I am a step away
from the precipice of ruin, away
from the edge of the end and honestly
I just want to take that one step and let
go of this all; I want to plummet till
I’m not afraid: till I am fully free.
















Every day I am slowly being forced
to keep moving. My body is marching
to its funeral and I am just along for
the ride- the world doesn’t care about how
you keep up. You simply must. And if your
bones are ground to dust, it is just a side effect
of dealing with yourself every single
day. Does it get better? Will I ever
hear my own heartbeat and smile? Will I ever hear
the future sliding up to my past and
want to laugh? Right now, the world is moving
like lightning, when all I want to do is breathe again.
Right now, the future knocks and I just hide.
Right now, I only want to breathe freely.
Right now, I am stifled by the thought of moving.










































Words have forever been stitching
a patchwork blanket of intricate
tales for me to wrap around myself
like armor; they keep me safe. They
keep me warm. Words have been
drawing me into the worlds they
create since before I can remember
and I have been falling, falling,
falling headfirst towards their magic,
and I’ve been slowly collecting
the ingredients to weave my own delusions
into something that might provide
the same feeling that other people’s
words do.
This is the beauty of fiction, this
is the beauty of words scrawled on
a page. It helps you forge your own path,
create your own identify, manoeuvre
your own destiny. Fiction creates a
song out of dissent, a dance out of
chaos, a movie out of worry, a
story out of imagination.
It’s been helping me recover from
blows I didn’t realise were being inflicted,
it’s helped me move past pain and
backwards to better days,
its helped me carve an opinion out of
a smattering of thoughts.
It helps me breathe, it helps
me stay sane, it helps
me escape to worlds better than my own.
Words have forever been stitching
an exquisite blanket of stories from
worlds beyond, of feelings I am yet
to recognise, of people I might
never know, of fiction.
Words have been providing me shelter
as I navigate the real; fiction has been
providing me solutions for problems
before I have them and I’ve been
reading, reading, reading, I’ve
been curled up on my bed, I’ve
been slowly healing every cut on
my body and now, I’m flourishing,
blossoming, surviving. And,
it’s not like fiction healed all
my wounds, but it gave me
the tools to heal myself, and
without it, I might have spiraled
into madness, into misery, into
depths I don’t want to reach.
So fiction may not have healed
all of my wounds, but here I am
today, here I am, warm within
my words, here I am immersed
in yet another book,
here I am, happy.
Here I am, reading.










Hold me up and you will
see the sunlight pass through
me like I’m as intangible as
a whisper or a dream, and you
will see that my bones have been
ground to dust that is simply floating
inside of me, clogging my lungs and
making it harder to breathe, so
hold me up and discover how
my synthetic self melts in your
arms till I’m just a bitter memory
of a lie you fell head over heels for;
I dare you to hold me to the light.
Today, you might love what you
think I am, but we’ve only been
meeting at twilight, you’ve only
seen the shadow of my true self
so if you want to discover the truth –
hold me up near the light and
watch this facade slowly disappear,
watch me slowly crumble, and
remember this warning because
you probably won’t like what you see.



You feel like the end of a chain
of bad decisions, like with you,
my body has given up; the dominoes
have been falling,
falling, falling, and
with you, the last one has
fallen and I have been
buried under the weight of your ego.
You feel like the result of years of no work, of years
of broken flowers and empty promises
of years of stupidity.
You feel like the condensed form of
every bad word I
have ever dared to utter, like every
slap I should never have given, like
the morning after pill; I taste my
bitter memories every time we kiss.
You feel like all the things I shouldn’t have done, and
this, this feeling is why I’m leaving.
Because if I stay, you won’t be the
one to blame. I’ll be the one burying
myself, and I don’t think I’m ready to
leave this life behind.
So I’ll be leaving, because
you feel like death and I,
I just want to feel alive.

Here we are.
I never thought I would be here,
today, with you, lying so close
together that our toes are touching,
that our hands are intertwined,
that I can feel your hot breath on my back.
Here we are.
Seems like a movie doesn’t it?
It seems like the rhyme I’ve been
searching for my entire life.
Your gaze doesn’t make me crumble,
like so many other’s, instead
it makes me rise up.
It make me touch the heavens, it
makes me want to learn chemistry
just so I can use the right words for this love.
There I was.
A shadow in the darkness,
A silence in a void.
Lost.
A soul full of dusky hopelessness.
Here I am.
A light in the dark,
Music heard in noise,
Found.
I’m not saying that you made me whole, no, you didn’t.
I’m saying you helped me find the
person I wanted to be,
The person I could always be,
The person I didn’t know how to be.
Here we are.
At our full potentials, racing
to the stars, bubbling
to the surface,
We are here.
And I’m so glad that this snapshot
exists, I’m so glad that
we came together,
I’m so glad this poem can attest to our love long after we’re gone.
We are here,
and it feels like magic, it feels
like the sun in winter,
it feels like us.
Us, with our toes touching,
with our hands intertwined.
Us, with your breath on my back.
We are here.
It feels like us, and
I’ve never been happier.












The blood slowly trickled down her temple and
dripped onto her folded palms from where
it fell on her knees and then on the floor,
forming a little pool of her sorrows.
She looked up at him, begging for mercy
and he smiled while taking another sip
of his drink and towering over her a man no
more, but a monster, just one wearing
a suit, just one
that nobody else seemed to see.















The red flowers move
with the wind- they are vibrant
like blood on bedsheets.
























My silence seems to be a chainsaw
slowly sawing through my throat
and it seems to be a jail
I’ve locked myself into, but
I don’t really feel like leaving.
Because even as it cuts me open,
it sews me shut and I’m glad.
I know I’m not suppose to do this,
but here I am.
Here I am.
Here I am, head barely attached to my body,
demons crawling out of me,
here I am.
Silent, and as long as
I’m not entirely unhappy,
I guess I’m in a good place.
I guess silence is like a nice place
to settle down in.
I guess, here I am.














Your eyes remind of the virgins hues


of silver and your body reminds me of pure


gold because most people stop looking the


moment they see your flesh, but


your heart is like lead, dull to the


touch but warm and welcoming no matter


what, yes, your heart is always like lead.















You never warned me.
I mean, that’s the least you could do considering that our relationship is profit for you.The first time I read your poetry, I wasn’t that shocked
that you wrote about us- more about how you lied. And you can deny it all you want, you can play the victim with all your friends, but just know that when I read your poetry- I know the truth.
Maybe if you had warned me, I wouldn’t have cared that you took our story and turned it into a cheap drama.
But now? I think I deserve my chance to speak up. Remember when you threw your phone at me? Remember when you told my mother I was bipolar? Remember when you made out with my best friend?
Yeah, I guess I was the villain. I was the one who ‘broke you’, the one who ‘shattered your ribcage’, the one who ‘took your love and gave you nothing’. Fuck you.
You and your metaphors can both go rot. I am not your dark sky, your snake, your cloud, your murderer, your shard of glass or your last love.
Maybe if you had told the truth about us, I wouldn’t have been mad. Maybe if you hadn’t left me for him, I wouldn’t be mad.
Maybe if I wasn’t still hung up on you, I wouldn’t be mad.
But I am.
Fuck, I am.














 
I scrawl little poems on notepad sheets and
pretend this is what real poets do.
I write notes to myself about mental health
that I don’t even need, I invalidate myself sometimes
just for the perks of the narrative.
Is this what real poets do?
I have been hiding my poetry behind my back,
I’ve been calling it rambles while you,
you call it poetry. You call it beautiful.
I call it a mess.
Is it creative to not market yourself? Or is it just stupidity?
Is it healthy to write or am I just
stuffing words into my throat and telling myself it’s food?
When was the last time I ate well?
My stomach hurts.
Note to self: this is poetry.
Note to self: you eat less.
Note to self: you’re a poet.
All of these statements make me sound
like the manic pixie dream girl image
I’ve been cultivating.
None of them are true.
This is not poetry, this is a shard of glass
aimed at your heart. This is a confession
I can’t make face to face.
I’m sorry for sending you poems in bad handwriting.
I’m sorry for hurting more than I should have.
Do real poets apologise?
Or do they just write it down as a reminder
of something they’ll always forget to do?
I’ve been scrawling words on notepad sheets
and calling it poetry. How much
time is left before someone calls me out on it?
Baby, I’ve never actually been inspired in class.
I just thought that’s what I’m supposed to do.
Like this, this is essentially poetry isn’t it?
An apology to an elusive second person,
coupled with self criticism, this
must be poetry. This has to be what real poets do.
I’ve been writing notes to my self for
far too long about things I don’t need to know.
I’ve forgotten how to separate myself from my fiction-
Note to self: you are real.
Note to self: you might not be a poet, but you still matter
Note to self: get over yourself.
If you left me now, how would I react?
Denial might wrap its arms around me,
whispering sweet nothing’s; maybe I’ll flee.
My frail self could break – no longer intact.
I could wither; I could decay in fact.
I might beg you to take me back, to be
my lover again, and you’ll be beastly;
mocking me. Truly, you’ll have an impact.
Alas, this is all simply a nightmare,
hopefully never to occur, just my
imagination causing me to cry.
When I’m with you, I can breathe – there is air.
You would never leave, you make me fly high
With you, I am free; I never despair.

















The colour red, a
vibrant reminder of love
and anger; of you.


























Love at first sight seems to
be a widely debunked myth, but what about
love at first conversation? Love at first kiss? Love at first class in the morning?
Love at the grocery store, helping you pick
up your groceries, love
at a club?
What about love at work, love
at school, love in a restaurant?
Love probably isn’t at first sight.
Love is the second sight, the
glance thrown over a shoulder,
the best friend.
Love can be so many firsts,
so many variations of the well
known first site, what about those?
Let’s talk about love online, love
between pages, between bedsheets, between
flights. Let’s talk about love
as a friend, as an enemy,
as a boss, as a stranger.
Let’s talk beyond the generalisations, because
when I first saw love, it
was not at first sight, but at the millionth one.
When I first saw love, it was sitting next to me,
it was laughing, it was adorable, and
it was definitely not where I expected it to be.
I had been looking for love in coffee shops and concerts,
in cute boys and first dates, I had
been looking in all the wrong places.
Because love, love is not at first sight no matter
how many times we wish it to be,
love isn’t convenient, love isn’t
easy. Love is outside the generalisations, love is
in the blind spot, love
is everywhere you forgot to look.
So, open your eyes first.
Look at the stars, look at then shine,
look after your friends, look at life
and pay attention to its minute details, pay
attention to the bigger picture,
pay attention to your life.
Look at yourself, look at your
goals, look at what you want, because
love is not at first sight, love is only present
after you find it for yourself.














Your lips linger on mine,
just a second longer than
something that should’ve meant goodbye, and
now there’s no stopping.
That second cost us the next hour;
our arms and legs are intertwined as
our minds think only about our bodies,
we are foolish.
There we were on the brink of a farewell, and
now here we are, sharing a bed
the next morning.
If only we could look at each
other when we weren’t overcome by desire,
maybe this could have worked.
But we can’t, so instead here
we are every other week promising
to never see each other again
while succumbing to sheer desire;
we are foolish, I say,
even as I give in once again,
even as I make sure my lips
linger a second too long,
even as I moan.
I am foolish.
I come back each time, hoping it’ll
be more than this but it never
is, I guess I just can’t
keep away, I guess I’ve lost control;
I am foolish, but
atleast every time we fall back
into this routine, I am satisfied.
Atleast I get to taste your lips once more,
atleast I had a good time.






We have built each
other up and
watched each other come
f
 a
  l
   l
    i
     n
      g
down enough times to know
that no matter what,
we will always exist best
around each other, because
we m  v   to different beats,
          o   e
I’m s l o w and s t e a d y, while
you’re too much of a fastincoming wave
Guess we provide a good contrast
to each other.













Being with you makes
me dissipate into dust;
I feel like nothing.























 
I never meant for this
to happen, I never thought
that it could. But then,
your words pierced my veil,
my armor and in a second,
I was sold.
I never thought that
we would be together, I never
thought I cared. But then,
your eyes looked at me with
such sincerity, such honor and in
a second, I was sold.
I never thought about you
at all, till suddenly, every waking
moment was spent with you
in the back of head. I never
thought I would be here, but here
I am, relearning this language
that I thought was dead.
I never thought this would happen,
but then again, was I thinking
at all? I never thought this
would happen, but how could I
even hope to withstand this
current of chemistry between us?
I never thought we would work
out, but here we are and I’m glad,
I’m glad, I’m glad. Here we are,
and I’ve never been happier
about being wrong.









The difference between
caring and not caring
used to seem like a fine
line drawn in sand that
could be washed away easily,
but now when I’m with you
I know that caring for
someone never really
requires a second thought
and there is not a line
between the opposites but
a wall, a country, a trench
deeper then anyone realises
because now, when I’m with you
I’ve realised that I never
think about the act of caring
because that’s just not how it
works, the entire idea is that
it’s effortless, and with you?
It is. It’s like we’re standing in
the eye of the hurricane, like
we’re reading, like we’re c a l m.
Before, I always thought of
someone genuinely liking me
as a chore, as an act, as a farce.
Now, I know that it’s not about
me, it’s about the other person and
whether they actually want
to be with me. Till now, I’ve
been ignoring the fact that actions
speak louder than words, but
today I no longer need to because
both your words and actions
are whispering the same sounds
into my ear, and today,
I’ve finally realised that it’s
about the effort, the effort you’ve definitely been ready to
put in. Today, I realised that
there is not a line in sand
separating you and him, but
a wall, a country, a trench.


The truth is that
I’m done lying to myself.
The truth is, words are no
longer keeping me afloat
and right now, I’m not even
sure if they ever did because
I’ve been choking on words
a whole lot longer than I realised,
I’ve been choking
on words almost since the
day he died and I can’t take it.
The truth is I can’t
take it anymore, the
world seems to be moving
faster than usual, and I
seem to be giving my body
ink instead of water, I seem
to be hanging the noose
around my own neck even
as I type this.
The truth is, words never
kept me afloat, they just
made it easier to escape
reality, they just made it
easier to believe I was
worth something.
The truth is that I give up,
I no longer want ink stained
lips and a linguistic heart,
I just want quiet.
I just want a head which
doesn’t make so much noise
trying to make itself heard.






She was choking, on
words and ink, on her high hopes
which were unfulfilled.
























The sun set as
quickly as it arisen, and
the paint on the walls is
dry to the touch, yet
throughout the day, time
seems to have been sped up,
yet stopped and our fresh
beginning has bloomed in
a single day almost like a
Rose. Yes, we have thorns;
our flaws are like pinpricks
to our porcelain lives and yet,
we have been given this
new start. The sun set as
quickly as it had arisen, and
now here we are in the moonlight,
our silhouettes illuminated and our
words are silky sweet celebrating
the dawn that will follow
midnight shortly, the day that
will set the tone for the rest of
the days to come. The sun
sets as quickly as it had arisen,
but each time it rises, it rises anew,
each time I see you, we start afresh











Cracked; like Absolutely Normal Chaos, like
The Black Reckoning, like
an Enchantress.
The girl was The Last Ghost,
lingering at The Midnight Gate,
just An Ember In The Ashes.
But with nowhere to go, she
was soon Among Thieves, soon
Torn between her morals and her fate,
soon at multiple Dead Ends.
But she fought; she escaped
The Merchant of Death, she was soon
Out Of The Woods and into
a Charmed Life instead.


















So I guess this is a thing.
I guess we now have to learn
how to adjust ourselves and
make space for each other’s
elbows and hands and voices.
But we already did that, didn’t we?
We learnt how to just be a long
time back but god, I feel like I’m
relearning the language of
your touch, God, I feel like I’m
taking a crash course in your
hands, God. I guess this is a thing.
I guess we have to learn how to
adjust around each other and just
hope we don’t step on each other’s
toes, just hope that we can
survive the hurricane we are.
Fuck. I guess this is a thing.
I feel like someone switched my
power off and you’re a mechanic,
slowly turning me back on, but God.
What if we blow up?
What if we implode and never
speak again?
What if we just can’t make it work?
Fuck, I’m terrified and just hoping
praying
wishing
dreaming
that we fuse the right way.








Roses don’t remind me of love,
they remind me of blood.
They remind me of a portrait of hell,
of a person being stabbed,
of a knife being twisted.
They remind me of purity, that is,
purity lost; white roses slowly getting speckled with dirt,
Children getting dusted with hatred,
A knife being twisted,
twisted, twisted
into a soul.
Roses are red, most of the
time, but sometimes they’re
yellow, like the intense Sun
beating down on you,
sapping your strength till
you are left empty.
They are pink like the girls
who made fun of you, like the
naive child you were, like the
weak person you still are.
They can be lilac, like the delusions of grandeur which
you still hold near, like
the pompousness in the step
of your boss, like the arrogance you see daily.
Roses are red, most of the time,
and then, they remind me of blood.
But sometimes, they aren’t,
and even then,
they don’t remind me of love, but
of negativity, of hatred, of the time
you threw the roses I got you down three floors.
So I guess, roses don’t remind me of love.
They remind me of you.







Cold and broken,
I wonder where my
final resting place will be.
Will it buried 6 feet under,
Burnt with electricity or fire;
whatever they desire.
whatever they desire.
This is not a victory match, its
mostly just sadness.
Sadness and shitty poetry go in hand, like
broken hearts and too many hopes; there are many broken places I have seen.
If you are a plate, would you have cracks?
If he wasn’t alive, then would his ghost haunt me?
If he was alive, then who’s ghost would fuck me over?


















I know love is supposed to be
this eternal thing where even
death doesn’t do us apart, but
mostly, I’m just happy it exists at all.
Love, for me, seems to function
much more like a survival strategy, like
a hope to make it to the next day,
together.
We’ve made it through a lot of days now, and
I don’t know what will happen on
our death beds, but
we are here, today, and we are together.
Is that not good enough?
I know love is supposed to be
this eternal thing, but honestly
death could do us apart, but
it can’t take these days away from me.
Death can do us apart, but
We’ll still have our memories.
Death can do us apart, but
I’ll still be glad I loved you.














The ocean rages
against the behaviour of
us; humanity.





Everything I have ever felt for you
has been an amalgation of good and bad.
Sometimes you remind me of
those dolls which come with different clothes,
which a child can keeping switching between.
Basically, it’s like you come with a set of personalities, each
with little quirks that make a world
of difference in your behaviour.
Some of these sets make
me fall in love with you,
but a lot of them don’t.
Talking to you sometimes feels like
having energy drinks and alcohol together; like
doing something you know isn’t a good idea.
That’s why I don’t tell you
even if I like you.
Because, what if you change at the last moment?
What if I fell for the wrong you?
Anyway, my feelings for you
have always been mixed,
which have created a cocktail
of mixed memories swirling in my head,
which have created blurs across your true persona.
Anyway, we wouldn’t last.
You’re still static and I’m still
dynamic; we are not the same.
Anyway, we are not opposites attracting.
We are opposites crashing, falling, stabbing each other.
And sometimes it sucks.
But today, looking through
my mixed feelings,
I know that we’re in the
best place we could possibly be.






It’s a bit ironic, isn’t it
that your name meant immortal, that you
died years before the average person.
Sometimes, it seems like a slap in the face
like the universe was mocking you since
the day you were born, since you entered this world.
I’ve been bitter ever since you left,
I’ve been angry at the entire world
However, I recently realised
that some things are no use fighting.
Some injustices can never reach
a court, so instead of being so damn angry
all the time, instead of bawling my eyes out,
I’m just glad I had you for 12 years.


















On first glance, my family
seems to be
having a few missing pieces.
People never quite understood that
even with people
missing, my family is happy.
On second glance, my family
seems to be
tight knit- holding hands- smiling.
We’re made up of introverts,
of trial and
error, of flaws; accepted.
On third glance, the bystander
can see the
pain present in our smiles.
There have been many hardships,
many tears shed.
We’ve got through this, together.
On fourth glance, the bystander
finally understands. My
family has seen it all.
The bystander realised that we,
we’ve been through
a lot, yet we’re happy.









Love was never known to me as a gentle thing.
No, for me, love was a whirlwind.
It entered my life
and exited it at the same speed.
It broke through barriers,
without bothering to put them back in place.
It never asked, no,
love just assumed and
I’m still not sure where its assumptions end and
where I begin.
Love was never known to me as a gentle thing.
Some people have described it as
calm, as
warm, as
home.
Love was never my home,
it wasn’t even part of it.
Love was my Monday morning drink,
my Wednesday evening shot,
my Friday evening one night stand.
And love was good.
Love may have not been the quintessential kind, but
love was the best storm I have ever witnessed.
Love may have broken me down,
but soon another love will come,
another love who’s job will be easier,
another love who shall build me back up.
Love was never gentle, love was
never my home, but
I was gentle and love will always
have a home in my heart.
Love was never my home, yet
the entire time, I was love’s home and
I’m glad I could be.






We were amazing,
we were sugary sweet love.
And then, you just left.
























Honestly, you used make me want to shred my ribcage
just to make it easier to show you my heart.
Honestly, the last time I saw you,
it felt like lightning had struck.
You didn’t even look at me then.
Honestly, I have been so infatuated
for the past few months that
every time you hit a roadblock,
every time you sentenced yourself to hell,
I resurrected you.
I resurructed you like the fool I was,
I was willing to look past it all.
Honestly, I was being delusional,
honestly, I just wish you were honest.
I just wish you were there for me,
I just wish you hadn’t given me hope.
Honestly, I just wished you had kicked me
at the start of this all instead of waiting,
instead of waiting and letting me slowly crumble.
Imagine how different this would have turned out.
Imagine how I would have felt.
I’ve wasted the last six months thinking about your hands, your lips, about you and honestly?
I’m over it.
Lightning is no longer striking my heart,
it’s striking you dead instead, and
honestly, I hope you burn.
If you hadn’t been a coward, if you
had just made your intentions clear,
I don’t think I would be writing this.
But you didn’t.
You didn’t.
So now, every time I see you,
every time you pretend you don’t know me,
I’ll set you afire.
Because honestly? You’ll burn as easily as paper, as wood,
you’ll burn in an instant because
talk is cheap, talk isn’t made to
withstand my wrath, and
since that’s all you consist of, yes, you’ll burn.
And honestly? I can’t wait.


Here we are, clashing
furiously on our
principles- I’m an
unstoppable force, you’re
an unmovable object
and things like
what you did that day,
where you made
proclamations about
someone you didn’t
even know, this is giving
me the drive to keep
going, things like
this are going to
mean the end for
you, because I’m
pushing hard and you’re
bound to move soon,
and when you do,
maybe you’ll realize
how the constant
judgement feels, maybe
you’ll realize that you’ve
had it easy all these
years and maybe you’ll
realise that you’ve
been in a position
of privilege, maybe
you’ll see that I’m
here to even the
playing field










Yesterday, I was attempting
exponentiation and I
realised that in my life,
though I have a finite
number of problems, they
all have the same
variable; you. Isn’t it funny
that though we done
talk often anymore,
you’re still making
such an impact in
my life. Day before, when
you walked into class
it felt like lightning had
struck, you set me on fire
until you looked at me.
Your gaze dismissed me
and it was like a sudden
downpour of cold water
jerking me back to life,
dousing the fire I felt,
reminding me that we,
we are nothing and
even though you’re in
every equation of my life
I could ever make, I’m
probably only in the ones
you threw away six months
ago and never looked
at again. Isn’t it funny,
that things like maths
remind me of you, but you,
you don’t remember me
till I’m standing in front of
you and even then, you
look right through me,
even then, I don’t mean
a thing to you. A month
ago, you tried to keep me
around, (to keep your
options open, I suppose),
And I guess today,
the curve I’m tracing is
no longer following
your equation,
and I guess today,
I no longer want
to be an option,
I guess today, I’m
just not seeing you
in my textbooks anymore















The clash of my
bangles is heard
as I rush down
the stairs,trying
to wear my jhumkas
while holding my
lehenga so that
I don’t trip and my
mother tells me
to hurry, because
she needs me to
hold the gift, some
mithai for the lucky
couple, along with
a delicate dinner
set. When my
grandmother sees
me, she beams,
telling me that
Indian clothes suit
me and I smile
because no matter
how many times
she tells me, I’m
always in jeans the
next day, I’m always
firmly in my comfort zone.
At the wedding,
old Bollywood songs
play, and waiters
move in-between
the crowds with
every single possible
food that can be
eaten from a toothpick.
Relatives I haven’t
seen in years tell
me that I’ve grown up,
that I’ve lost weight,
that I look beautiful.
I smile at them
over and over
again till my face
feels like its set in
stone. They do not
realise. They tell me,
I look beautiful.
The rest of the night
passes in a blur with
a few snapshots
engraving themselves
into my memory.
When I reach home,
I take off my earrings,
and half asleep already,
I slip into my pajamas.
Tomorrow will be
another event, another
outfit, another
profanity muttered to
myself. I fall asleep,
dreaming of my jhumkas,
dreaming of my
wedding, dreaming of
the future.









It’s been two and
a half years, some
people call you my
lover now. But we
both know that’s a
lie, that’s an exaggeration
because this love, this
love is not reciprocated.
Well, some people may
disagree but I know
the truth, I’m simply the
person you fall back on,
the person you rely on,
the person who will
always be there. On
the other hand, its been
two and a half years and
your feelings are still
uncertain, still a maybe,
still not enough to
make you care about me.
Mostly, I’m okay with it,
I’m used to the silence,
the butterflies, the love
with no reciprocation, but
sometimes the uncertainty
gnaws at my heart, and
collects and forms that
lump in my throat, and
triggers my flight mode the
moment I look at your face,
and lately, all that goes on
traces back to you,
everything is a path that
leads my mind to your
eyes, and I’m sorry, but
the uncertainty might
just be too much.


 
 

Lately, my voice has
not been my own, my
inadequacy has been
the one speaking, and
there always seems
to be a lump in my
throat, I am choking.
Choking on air,
choking on life,
choking on me.
But I guess this is
how it works, right?
People move on,
people leave, people
don’t care, like you,
who doesn’t care
about my words.
So I guess this is
me saying I’m
drowning, me saying
I feel like I’m shouting
myself hoarse in an
empty desert, me
saying ‘sorry. I know
you want to leave, and
you can.’ This is me
wishing I could leave
myself behind.
Lately, my voice has
not been my own
and I have felt like
crying constantly.
Lately, I’ve been thinking
about people not
caring alot. I’ve been
thinking about him alot.
I’ve been wishing
for miracles for a
while, and this mind
of mine is driving me
to ruin and I just want
to survive, I just
want to live
So lately,
when my
inadequacy speaks,
I let it.














Because 2015 was the year
where I was myself, a
bit not okay, a bit
anxious, a bit of
bad and a lot of good.
I wouldn’t take back a
single moment; whether it
was the feeling I felt when
I talked to him, or the
crying I did in my room,
every second defined me.
2015 was when I nearly
gave up, but I didn’t; when
I nearly broke down, but
I didn’t; when I nearly
became yours, but I
didn’t. And that’s okay.
2015 was me setting
boundaries, was me
opening up, was me
surviving, and
according to me
I did a damn good job.












Yes, today has been
a long day and
you don’t have
the strength to
help me, but
please try
Tomorrow will
hopefully be
better and you will
soar to new heights.
I know sometimes
you feel so terrible
that everything is
tinged grey
And I know that
sometimes you
soar so high that
everything seems
perfectly fine, but
none of these
are a real reflection
Most days you simply
try to survive
You just get by
And that’s all right too.
I guess what I’m
trying to say is
everything is
temporary right now
One day, you will be
in a stable place, but
today is not that day
And tomorrow is
unlikely to be, so
don’t expect too much
Just survive for now
Don’t be crushed
forever by ideas that
won’t matter in a
few years
Just survive, that is all
Just survive



If I agree to
help you out
once, it doesn’t
mean that I
will help you
out always. I am
sick of bailing
you out.
Money is short
and I have bled
myself dry to
provide you
with water, and
I don’t want
to be your
fall back
anymore, so
stop using me
Because I am
absolutely livid
I just want
you to do
your own part
Why is that
so hard?











Days are getting shorter.
As winter approaches, my
luck runs out
The more time I need,
the less time is there
The happier I feel at home,
the worse I feel in school
Days have been getting shorter, and it feels
like a metaphor for
my temper, like
there are few sunlit hours
during the month of
December, and there are
just a few precious
seconds before I lose my mind
It’s been getting chilly, and
I’ve been feeling cold and callous
The winter is seeping into
my body and my heart
is slowly hardening to
most people I know
And I don’t feel bad about it.
Let my heart freeze, let my
demons reveal themselves,
let me lose my mind, let
me rebuild myself, as
long as I’m the one rebuilding
As long as I’m the one
changing me
as long as I’m the one
in control of myself
Let winter come
Let me freeze for now
Because I know that
once I thaw, I’ll be
the person I want to be
I’ll be the person I’m
trying to be
Winter is approaching, and
I’m running out of time
But its alright
It’s alright.
These months will
simply make me better.
Today I thought of an
alternate universe where
you are not made up of
question marks and passivity. A world
where you would call
me up frantically saying
‘Listen to me. I know we’re
nothing for now but I’m
really looking forward to the day we
are together forever. Listen
to me. I haven’t liked
anyone after I met you and
no matter how hard I try to erase you
You are in every future I imagine. Listen,
I might be in like with you
because love is too strong a word
and I’m still scared of commitment, but you
you make me almost fearless.
Listen, I think I can finally make this work.
I think it’s about time we
tried to be together.
Listen, lets be together’
But this is only a flight
of fancy, only a whimsy
This is only what I want to say.
In this universe, we are a
befuddled mess, and it
makes no difference to
your life. I am the only
one suffering here.
And I don’t know whether to
laugh or cry because I would
invest everything in us
But you, you wouldn’t
even spend a rupee.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sometimes I imagine you kissing me.
And it’s always in this angry way, like
I’m screaming at you and you
decided to apologise with your mouth
In these flights of fancy, I mostly melt in your arms
I mostly forget about our fights, I mostly
concentrate on kissing you until we fuck it up again.
Even when I see us together it’s a mess.
We just seem to be toxic for each other, like
how you pick all the wrong fights to start, and you
turn me into a nervous condescending wreck
Maybe we’re meant to stay away from each other, but like
you’re something I’ll never get over, like
opposites attract and we are synonyms clashing
We should repel but instead all we do
is come back for this brawl
Lately I’ve imagined kissed you
It’s always a bit more war.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Why am I
always writing
about you
You are
not the one
for me
I don’t want
to kiss you
anymore
Or at least
that’s what I’m
telling myself
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

I have never been depressed
or had an anxiety disorder
I’ve never been diagnosed
with any sort of
mental illness, but
I have overcome
different blockades
and one thing I have
believed in throughout
is the future.
I might speak from
a position of privilege
but I wholeheartedly
believe in visions
of tomorrow
So whether you
are simply sad
or suffering in
a worse way
please know
you are a person.
Feeling negative things
doesn’t make you damaged
When you think of the future
don’t dream of a cure
for your beautiful mind
Dream of a future
where you live in
harmony with your
imperfections and
dream of a future
where you accept
who you are
Dream of a future
where you are
simply being you
and you don’t have
yourself for it.
Maybe I speak with
a privileged mindset
but I believe everyone
has that future
And it might be
idealistic to think
this way, but
dreaming and wanting
to be a positive person
only make your journey
towards accepting yourself
a faster one.
 

 











I LIKE YOU. And you’re wondering, why
that statement needed to be
in capitals, you’re
wondering why I need
to say it so loudly
But I like you. And it’s
a fact now, a mere statement
Because I like you the way I like myself,
hesitatingly.
Or the way I like poetry, I don’t quite
understand it, but I know
it makes me feel something.
Something which vaguely resembles Diwali night, or a rainy day with books.
Something which kind of reminds me of you.
I like you, and its not in a secret way, or a
whisper way
Or a hush way
It’s in a scream this to the world way,
A does everyone know how good this feels way
I like you, and I never thought
I would say this, but
I’m glad.













It’s 3am and my mouth is
speaking of its own accord and I am
running on pure adrenaline
I’m looking forward to what’s coming, but
I’m dreading what’s coming and I know
that a contradiction, but
aren’t most people contradictory?
People change their minds, people are fickle
And people don’t analyse themselves so much
Buts that’s only because
I’m analysing for them
I’m not sure what this poem
was meant to be
But now it is simply an
ode to people
And adrenaline
And what lies ahead
















This is not writing
This is not poetry
This is my soul on a screen
This is my feelings stained with ink
This is a cry for help
This is me confessing
This is a rant
This is a scream
This is me going mad
This is an analysis of my bad choices
This is romanticization
This is using metaphors
This is me hiding
This is not writing
This is not professional
This is not a career
This is the way I stay sane
This is an anchor
This is me in the worst way possible
This is me in the best way possible
This is a contradiction
This is an utter mess
This is a story
This is a fairy tale
This is not poetry
But I don’t have a better word for it
So, I guess ‘poetry’ works










The fire started as just
a small spark, hues of
red and yellow
danced in the air
They crackled with
fiery enthusiasm and
a naive belief that they,
the flames
were invincible
As they rose higher
and higher, so did
their confidence
But the fire forgot
that it survives on others
And soon,
it ran out of victims
















Missing you
used to feel like
a flood, slowly
overwhelming me.
But now it is
not so life threatening
It’s not so
dangerous, or scary
Instead, its like
a constant
that I’ve learnt
to live with



















I know what love looks like.
I know what love feels like.
It’s messy, like
children playing a game
or an artist covered in paint
It’s beautiful, like
sunsets and cold nights,
Messy buns and
aesthetic blogs
It’s heart wrenching, like
your favourite book, ending
the best friend you don’t talk to anymore, and
that those times you were targeted unintentionally
It doesn’t come in a particular shape or size,
it’s not available easily.
But when it arrives, you will know its there.
You will recognize love when they smile at you for the first time
and your heart beats faster for that second
You will recognize love because your soul will see theirs, and instantly
click.
I know what love looks and feels like, there are
a thousand ways to describe it
I know what love is,
and what we have?
It definitely isn’t love
It doesn’t even
come close.









Im trying so hard
to not be overwhelmed
That my creativity
is overwhelmed.
I’m trying to keep myself together
But little parts of me aren’t fitting in properly
It isn’t even that I’m sad
I’m just overwhelmed
By nothing at all
I’m overwhelmed
By my solitary existence
I’m overwhelmed
By my loneliness
And I just want to escape it all
For a bit















Your endeavors
To provide me
With poetic words
Have failed miserably
I wonder
How someone
Can possibly
Be so utterly terrible
At simply
Choosing a word




















You tell me to say something meaningless
And my mind is blank
Because everything I ever say to you
Is a loaded gun
Each word is measured and precise
My mind is blank
Because everything about you holds meaning
And I don’t know how not to think





















I know
I’ve been irritable
this week
And I’ve tried
so hard to
keep myself together
But I’m afraid
to tell you
today was
the last straw
I don’t want
to talk to
any of my friends
I don’t want to
talk to you
Until I feel
a little
less unwound















Usually when I like someone
words flow freely
I can write pages
on how he looks and acts
and smiles and feels
But this time around
the words are lodged
In my throat
Unable to translate
To my hand




















I wonder if he remembers the conversations we used to have
He blushed every time he saw me
But asked me to stay with him nevertheless
I wonder if he remembers feeling anything for me
Because I remember how it felt
When he still cared
He was awkward and so was I
But our awkwardness adjusted around each other
Till it was almost comfortable
It doesn’t feel like that anymore
I remember him texting me and calling me and talking to me
I just never anticipated him ending it
He has moved on
But I remain stuck in what I thought would be
The foundations of our relationship
But now I’m stuck in another could’ve been
Another would’ve been
Another never to be
I just don’t know how to make him miss me
Like I miss him
Because his monosyllabic responses
Are like little knives
Designed to wound not kill
(He must want to keep me alive
To feel the pain)
I never anticipated
Him leaving
(Before I did,
I always thought
I was the fickle one)
And now
That we’re on the precipice
Of never being anything
I just want
(I just need)
to make him stay





It is easy, to move on
when you are not the only one
It is easy, to leave places
when nobody is staying
But what is hard
is to be the one left
It is hard
To stay, and know
that you are the only one





















You don’t know whether you like me or not
And I don’t know whether its the thought of you
That powers my daydreams
Or the thought of who I think you are
I don’t know whether I’m in love with the actual you
And I don’t know whether to compare you to summer nights or rainy days
Because you remind me of both, in completely different ways
You don’t know whether you like me or not
And I don’t know whether you’re faking it or not
I don’t know whether all the potential we have
Is in my head or not
I don’t know whether we actually have a shot
And I don’t know how to describe the way you talk
And the way you blush at everything
And I don’t know how to write poetry
About a love so pure and so uncorrupted
I don’t know how to write about something that barely occurs
(I’m so used to writing about poison,
That I’m still not quite used to sugar)
I don’t know whether to say hi to you
I don’t know what you actually think
You don’t know whether you like me
And sometimes
I wish it were that easy for me to say
Because I know, beyond a doubt
That I do like you
I just don’t know what happens now
I just don’t know
How to avoid a dead end
I just don’t know
How to keep you in my life
You said you don’t know whether you like me or not
And oh, how I wish this was simpler
How I wish this was easy
How I wished you knew
How I wished you knew,
And didn’t hesitate to tell me




I want you to know
That over the past few months
I have fallen for you
Head over flat slippers
(I don’t wear heels, you see)
And I now go to sleep
Only after imagining a situation involving you
That I know will never come true
And I know I fall in love with the idea of people
Much too often
But to me, the idea of you
The essence of you
Feels like rainy storms and summer nights
Like fireflies and after eights
You’re pop songs being sung in loud discordant voices and 2AM conversations
And I know I am rambling
But that’s what you make me feel
That’s what you make me do
But I just wanted you to know
That every answer you don’t give
Drives another nail into the coffin of our relationship
(And my heart, but you probably don’t care about the mess it is now)
And not answering isn’t helping anyone
I just want you to know
That the essence of not answering
Is mayhem and confusion
All I want is clarity
Clarity on where we stand
Clarity on who I am to you and who you want me to be
Not answering just leaves space for questions
Not answering makes me question everything I ever said
Not answering doesn’t help anyone
If you’re breaking my heart, tell me first
(I like to have control over little things like
Who I loan my heart out to)
Over the past few months
I have fallen for you
Head over flat slippers
And I hope you fall for me too
But if you don’t
Don’t not answer
Because out of all the ways you could break my heart
That hurts the most
The fact that
I didn’t matter enough
For you to answer
So I just want you to know
I am awaiting answers


I divided myself into levels when I was twelve
And ever since then whenever I meet people
I greet them like they’re entering a lift
‘Welcome to level one’ I say
‘Enjoy your stay here’
‘If you want to move forward, you just need to show me I can trust you’
Whenever I meet someone new
I think about them for days
I think about whether they’re at level one
Or at the level where I don’t care yet
Whether they will be the ones to finally save me
Whenever I meet someone new
I imagine showing them the intricacies of my soul
I never do, of course
Because they need to pass the levels first
I divided myself into levels when I was twelve
After I witnessed three funerals
The levels dictate how I behave
They make my life easier
They make it easier to pretend
I divided my soul into three levels some time ago
And I am yet to meet someone
Who is willing to see them all
Who is there, unconditionally
And I don’t blame people, I really don’t
I just long for what could’ve been
I just wish I could take someone straight to level three
And begin from the end
But alas, the levels are there for a reason
And the lift can’t bypass any
So I just wait for someone
Someone to stay long enough for the lift to reach level three
I divided my soul when I was twelve
And I’ve regretted it many times since
But never enough to remove them
Never enough to get rid of this system
Never enough to showcase my soul
I divided my soul when I was twelve
And I have stayed within the restraints my past self placed on me
I have never broken my chains
Instead, I walk into the cage my past made for me
Every single day

Maybe I agree with her
Maybe we are falling apart
And maybe the reason
I didn’t realise before
Was because
I was the one
Who caused the
Pillars of friendship
To shatter





















It has come to my notice
That love is fleeting
And you are just a phase
And no matter how long this lasts
I will weather the storm
I will ride the ship
I will not let anything
Change who I am
And whether it takes
Two years or
Two days
You will soon
Disappear
But the hills will remain
The city will remain
The winds and rains will stay
For nature is eternal
And you and me
Are definitely
Unnatural














I wonder if
Wondering whether
I am a good person
Will make me a better person
























I have a rather queer habit
Of dreaming up
Nightmares for myself
Whether it involves being bullied,
Being forced to speak in front of a huge group of
Insensitive people
Or simply
Something hurtful
I like to dream up
Worst case scenarios
And solve them in my head
Most of them are simply odd
With even odder solutions
And what scares me
Is that while these solutions
Have been proven
To work
I would have never dreamed of doing
Or saying something
Like them
And this makes me wonder
Whether my worst case scenarios
Are simply me dreaming
Of best case me
Put in a situation
Where the newly created me
Can show off her
Grace and poise
I wonder
Whether these nightmares
Are actually
Disguised dreams







Stop trying to
Justify your cruelty
By saying you are
Simply ‘honest’
Because you
Are not honest
You are a coward
Who tries to hurt others
With words
Simply because
You are insecure
And desperately need
People to notice
You. Don’t hide behind
The word ‘honest’
Because it signifies
Something that is
Inherently good
And you
Are not.














Maybe to you
The topics we
Argue about are just
Jokes and you
Consider my stance
On real issues ‘funny’
But to me
These are things
Which affect people
So don’t bother
Having a debate with me
If you’re not
Willing to listen
Don’t talk to me
If you don’t take
Me seriously
Why should I
Respect you
And your opinion
(Which is
Obviously wrong, but
I still listen)
When you
Have never
Cared about what I say
And how I became
Who I am
I refuse to respect you
If all I get in exchange
Is derision
Why should I read up
On your interests
When you simply
Scoff at mine
I may be
Small, but
My personality is volatile
And you
Make me want
To explode
With anger
At the way you
Treat my
Opinions
I simply want
To memorise
Every single part
Of you
And save these memories
And feelings
For a rainy day
I simply want to
Stare at you
While you talk
About yourself
I want to be near you
For no apparent reason
I want to be there for you
I want someone to be there for me
And I want that someone
To be you
I want your
Lips and arms and legs and thoughts
embedded in my brain
Forever
I want to know
What makes you who you are
I want you to know
I accept all the parts of you
I shunned before
I want you near me
Because you want to be there
Not because
You want to be somewhere
With someone
I want to be
I need to be
As important to you
As you are
To me





I hope your
Curiosity
Gets the best
Of you
I hope
You like
What you see
I hope
You don’t dismiss
My reality
And I wonder
Whether you realise
I write about
You too


















I am in a
Habit of
Referring to people
As nice
No matter how
Close you
Are to me
You’re probably
Just ‘nice’
(Or in some
Rare cases
‘Really nice’)
And as a
Writer,
A poet and
An avid reader
Its quite
A shame
That my
Vocabulary
Is so limited
When it comes
To people
I care about












Apparently smiling
At your phone
Is not very healthy
But I cannot help
But laugh to
Myself when you
Text me a bad joke
Or say something sarcastic
And I think
It shows just
How much power
Words have over us
That someone
Far away can
Make us smile
Simply with a
Few letters
















For all my talk
About mental illnesses
I’ve never really
Dealt with someone
Self destructive
Now, confronted
With someone
Whose only wish is
To stop existing
I’m not sure
How to react
What is the appropriate response
To being told that
Your friend
Wants to plummet
Towards the ground
And feel the concrete
Against her cheek
What do I say
To save
A life?















Walking on
The beach
Hand in hand
With you
The best part of the day
Was not your smile
Or your twinkling eyes
But when you
Pressed a seashell
Into my hand
And simply said
That you believed
In fate and destiny
And that the moment
You saw that seashell
You knew
It had washed up on shore
Simply to
Be with me
And when I opened
My hand
To see the little gift
You had given me
I saw brilliant blues
And lovely hues
Of pink and purple
And white too
All mixed up
In that little seashell
And when I looked up
At you, in wonder
You simply smiled
And said
That I am
A fusion of everything
Beautiful
Every shade of my personality
You said, was equally
Mesmerising
And that little seashell
And the words you said
To me, then
Made sure that
I would never
Fall out of love














I think my feelings
For you
Are fading
Not because
I like you any less
But simply
Because
I don’t have the time
To think about you
I have friends
With real problems
I have friends
Who I need to make sure
Are okay
And I have friends who need help
And I would rather spend my time
Thinking of ways
To help her out
Than ways
I could be with you
My love for you
Has taken the backseat
In my life
We are
Not a priority
Anymore













I think I’m only at peace
When the sun has disappeared completely
And I am free
Of social obligations
For the day
And I creep into my room
shut the doors tight
Put on my favourite CD
And just lie down
On my bed
And revel in
What the day has been
And what tomorrow could be


















I have realised
That I will never
Be able to explain
How I feel when you
Talk to me
And I will never
Be able to pinpoint
What you did
To make me
Feel this way
And maybe
I’m okay with that
Maybe
My love
For you is
Inexplicable
















Don’t take
Responsibility
For my decisions
And don’t
Apologise
For my actions
I choose what I want
And I may or may not
Choose correctly
But no matter what
The outcome
I made my decision
On my own
And the responsibility
Is mine
Don’t apologise
For something
I set in motion
You were just
Part of the outcome
You were not
The one
Who made
The wheels turn
So don’t say
Sorry











I never knew
How frustrating it could be
To keep something inside
Till you felt bloated
And I worried that
Someone would
Prick me like
I was a balloon
And all that I felt
For you
Would come tumbling out
And I never knew
How frustrating it could be
To not be able to share fully
With anyone
What I actually feel
And I never knew
How frustrating it could be
To feel alone
Regarding matters
Of the heart.














Not sure how I ended up where I am now
But I ended up here
With you
So I’ll be alright
Since
I’m with you.






















I don’t understand
Whether I dream about him
Because of
Him or because of
My insecurities
Maybe because to say something would be
Scandal and I have always
Been one to stay away from
Danger but over the past
Months I have noticed him
And realised
That even though he
Is not for me
He is for somebody
and I can’t help but wonder
Who
















Most days
The turmoil inside me
Lessens when I write
But some days
There is nothing to write
there is nothing to say
So I just lay there
Trying to sleep
While tears roll down my cheeks
And wildfire burns my insides




















Maybe I think about
Our lips touching
And our bodies
Intertwined
Because of recent
Events or maybe its
Because to go near you
Is to jump into a fire willingly
And pretend the burns
Are soothing
And even though
I have always been one
To stay away from
Danger, you are constantly in my thoughts
Maybe my thoughts
About us walking hand in hand
And actually having a
Healthy relationship
Stem from the fact
That to have a relationship
With you
Is a area in my mind labeled danger
And everyone knows
Banning something sweet only makes it sweeter
I wonder if when I taste you
You’ll taste sweet
Like my heart perceives you to be
Or turn out bitter
Just like poison
Which I
Swallowed by mistake








Denial worked in its mysterious ways
I thought of you often,
But only as a friend
With acceptance
Its harder to ignore
The fact that
You feel like more than a friend
And my thoughts
Treat you like more
Isn’t it funny
How someone like me
With such an aversion to danger
Could fall for you


















I have never quite fallen in love
I usually crept into it
I was cautious, never reckless
But with you
I think of nothing else, but you
And I dream of something more
Than what we have now
I am falling, because
I jumped
I jumped and did not think of the consequences
And I am now falling
Madly in love
With you


















Someone should attach a warning to your eyes
Your gaze was so intense
Fire lit up my insides.
























Twist me into something beautiful
Soften my personality till it fits the mould
Slice away half my stomach
Till I am the size they wish I was
Soak my contradictions in warm water
And wring them all out of my body
Sharpen my cheekbones
Elongate my legs
Make me smile and laugh
At all the right times
Get rid of all the things
That make me who I am
Until there is just an empty shell left.
Twist me into something beautiful
And since I am not beautiful,
Make me someone else.
Twist me into someone else,
Who does everything correctly
On the first go
And does not understand how people can be sad
Twist me into something beautiful
Twist me into someone else.













You are static where I am dynamic:
As waves of my being
Crash into your rigid self
I only find pain and anger
And withdraw into myself
But I never learn
And my tide keeps on coming
To you, the beach
And you keep on pushing me away
Because you are static where I am dynamic
And you don’t feel like moving
Just yet



















Never tell me
My opinion does not matter
Simply because
I am a girl
When, in the dark
I smile at you
And while crawling into your bed
I slit your throat
Know that
You were killed by a girl
Who recognised in herself
The monster needed to put another to sleep
Remember
The ones who survive
Did so because
They knew
They knew about
The inherent strength
In the ‘weaker’ sex
And bowed to its power
Don’t you wish
You had known too?
And in your ignorance
You tried to shut me up
This was my warning
Next time
I will haunt you in hell
If I must.








Home is where the heart is
They say
Well then for me
Home is all around me
It is the way you smile at me
When I meet someone after a long while
My clothes, my books, my music
The people who care about me
The people who are now gone but will always be there
The memories are home
The future is home
Because everything
I do I invest in it
My heart is beating in my chest, yes
But its scattered around the worlds
For me
Home is everywhere I have made memories yet
And all the places I’ve visited in my head
Home is not a person
Or a place
Its life as I live it out
And my thoughts
And emotions
Home consists of what makes me
And if I gave you a complete list
You’ll never have enough time
To read all the places
My heart has been to
Home is living for me
And that is what it’ll always be








I envy those people
Who can be angry
With stone hearts
And emotionless faces
Who get taken seriously
Simply because they cannot care anymore
I envy those people
Who are dry
And cold
With voices which don’t shake
And tears which never fall
Who will always have the upper hand
Because the moment
My voice shakes
Or tears roll down my cheeks
Apparently my opinion
Is worthless
And whatever I say
Is coming straight
from the trash can
In a world where
Expressing your emotions
By word or by brush
Is creative
But speaking the same
Is weak
I don’t understand
How not to care









As I grew up
I taught myself to shrink
It was a game to me
‘How small can I get today?’
Now, permanently shrunk
I wonder if I’m like a miniature painting
You’ll look at it
And wonder at how small it is
But you’ll never look at the details
You’ll never seen the work put into it
You’ll pass it without a glance
Now, permanently shrunk
I wonder what
It will take
For people to notice
I am more than just short
More than just cute and ‘child-like’
Now, I wonder
If anyone sees the detail in me















If emotion
Makes me weak
I am proud to say
I am the weakest of them all
























The reason war and love are so alike
Is because both are dances
albeit different types
Love is all about graceful movements
Its falling into each other
And simply staying
You inhale and pirouette
I exhale and glide towards you
We are not synonyms
We are the same
In love we come together
And as love ebbs
We fade away
War is full of harshness
It is organised chaos
Which took someone time to plan
When you inhale I stab you
When I exhale I’m brought to my knees by a knife at my neck
War is a cunning game
Played by the rich
In war we are antonyms
We come together in a fit of madness
And the victor is the one who swallows the other whole
War comes to a stop like a choir without practice
Its sudden and stark
And only then you realise the mangled mess you left behind
War and love are both dances
Separated not only by their circumstances
By also how you and I
Move to different beats








And as the day
Goes on
And the aged
Slowly die off
The principles
And preconceived notions
Of terrible societal problems
Will wear away
But so will
The principles
And preconceived notions
Of family



















And they sit
And they drink
And they talk about the
Past
Present
Future
They shake their heads
Over bad decisions
Made by their friends
And agree on points
Over and over again
And they talk about
People decaying
And
I wonder
If they are heading
The same way
















And just before I left
He grabbed my wrist
And made me promise that
I would eat two meals today
So I forced a smile
And promised
When I reached home
I ate and ate and ate
Till I was as full as he
Wanted me to be
And even though
I could feel fat appearing
On my bones
I ate till
I no longer could
Because I promised
After I summoned the
Willpower to move
I ran to the bathroom
And puked and puked and puked
Till I was as empty as I
Wanted to be
And I smiled
With that sour taste in my mouth
Because I was a step
Closer to becoming a paper doll
Later when he called me up
I told him all about what I ate
And he was happy
Because he thought I would be normal
And I was happy
Because I deceived him
Without lying
Since he never asked
If I kept the food in my stomach






Dont you dare
Tell me that
Girls are like locks
And when many keys
Can open a singular lock
The lock is useless
Because for me
Girls could be sharpeners
Praised for their ability
To sharpen pencils
But honey
I know better
Than to compare humans
To items
Because I know
That we are people
And sharpeners and locks will never
Take into account that we
Are living
Breathing
Loving
Human beings
And the number of people
I sleep with
Shouldn’t determine my
Self worth
Simply because
To you
I was a faulty lock









She looked at his pitiful body
Lying chained to the floor
And simply smiled
She crouched next to him
And laughed as she
Carved a masterpiece
On his flesh
Rivulets of his blood
Flowed down his body
And he screamed for mercy
She stood up
And inspected him
Her heels clacking
While she walked
She was satisfied
With what she had reduced
A proud man to
She then left him alone
To his misery
Knowing that he will never be whole
And he spent the rest of his days
Hating himself
For the day he crossed
Her










And as the bridge beneath us
Broke
And i
Fell
You caught me
And we built another bridge
Which will never break
Since we built it on our love.

















It started with her
When she said,
“You will be with him
You should be with him
You probably will be with him”
And since then
The possibilities
Have overwhelmed me
They have taken over me
Forget about reality,
I now live in a fantasy
Where you look at me
And smile.


















With the rain
Came this feeling
Of being clean for the first time
It was like the rain washed you away
And when the rain took you
It took layers of me too
And for the first time
I felt bare
With no walls to protect me
I did not sit and cower
I rose
Like a phoenix from the ashes
I rose
And even if I emerged as a new person
This new person
Is fully me
There is no trace of you left on me
I am a new slate
I am clean.











I haven’t been able to finish a book for three months
And I am unable to listen to any new music now
I am watching my soul slowly sink in the quick sand
And I can do nothing
Except for
Watch it disappear.
All I am looking forward to is change
I have convinced myself that as winter fades
So will my depression
And I will emerge as a new person in summer
But its hard to change
When people’s perceptions don’t
And its hard to change
Without mourning the person I will leave behind.
I am unable to enjoy the things I used too
And I don’t know whether that’s my fault.
Writing used to be something I do for fun
Now
This is how I save myself
This is how I survive
This is how I keep my soul from attacking itself
My pen is my razor, my pills, my noose
I’m not sure if its killing me
Or keeping me alive.
Its like I’m in a cage of my own invention
And as I watch everyone else live
I wonder
Why am I not feeling those things?
And I’m in a cage of my own invention
And
There is no way out.







Maybe his love faded like winter does
It took some time
And the days became brighter for him
He started shedding his covers
It happened so slowly
He wasn’t even sure it was real
He refused to believe it was
He kept his coat close
He kept me close
But then one day
It was just too hot to deny it
Summer had come
And my time had ended
Or maybe it was like lightning
It happened one day while walking back home
A flash of enlightment
And that’s it
He knew he couldn’t deny it
The rain would come
And I would go.















Me telling you about my poetry
Is me handing you the key to heart
It is me telling you I am a mess but you are one of the things that keep me afloat
When I tell you about my poetry
Don’t laugh at me
I just gave you my soul
Do not laugh when you see my darkness
When you read about yourself
Hear me apologise a million times
Repeat after me:
My poetry is an outlet.
My poetry is exaggerated.
My poetry saved me.
My poetry does not mean I hate you.
If I send you poetry
Remember I probably am feeling sad at that moment
Don’t mention my sadness
If I am always sending you poetry
I may be depressed
You can do nothing about it
When you read my poetry
You read my thoughts at 2am
You read what I feel when silence surrounds me
Help me keep the silence away
When I tell you about my poetry
Do not laugh at me
Do not say ‘that’s cute’
Do not say my life is not worth writing about
When I tell you about my poetry
I hand you the key to my soul
Don’t break the lock just to spite me
Do not smash the key.
If I tell you about my poetry,
You are one of the things that keep me afloat
Do not let me sink


Dear friend,
Every time you look in the mirror realise you are beautiful. Realise that I don’t have that advantage.
Dear friend,
I am there for you through everything you will ever go through. Know that my love is unconditional. Realise that I know yours isn’t.
Dear friend,
Know that you are worth so much more than seeing me sad for absolutely no reason. Realise that I will understand if you walk away from me.
Dear friend,
Feel free to assure yourself I’m fine. I’ll go along with it for you. Realise that I will never make you pretend to be something you’re not.
Dear friend,
Realise that I love you forever. Know that I know you don’t feel the same about me.
















Loneliness now accompanies me
Everywhere I go
It’s that silent companion
Letting me know I am alone
Anxiety is  my best friend
It creates all my problems
And sticks with me through them all
I need it but it wants me too
It just can’t let me go
Depression is my love
Kisses me hard
Holds me close
Tells me I’m worthless
And that I will not survive
They are the golden trio
Without them I am nothing
They shaped my personality
And I cannot give them up.















Brilliance is an art,
Learnt before I’m old enough to realize what the word means.
Brilliance is an act,
It’s playing a part, and doing it well.
Shrinking is an habit,
Learnt before you realize what’s wrong.
Wrong
Is when all I want is someone to care,
And all I get is,
Indifference.




















It’s been a year since anything important happened to me
Like you
And as of now
I live in the past
Because all I want is to go back to our 10pm conversations
Or go through the whirlwind memories we created
2014 was me shrinking
2014 was the year I told myself I grew
2014 was the year I learnt the words anxiety and depression
It was the year I realized my body is mine
My brain is mine
And I might not want any of it
It was also the year I realized
Everyone likes me
But nobody cares
And,
I just want to go back to the time I felt loved and I felt wanted and I felt fucking invincible in your arms and I don’t want to grow up, I don’t want to be alone. All I want every night is for you to remind me why I should love myself because darling I’ve forgotten half the list already.
2014 was me tricking myself into thinking I was fine
And I would like to begin 2015 by saying I may not be.



Maybe your love is like thunder
Big gestures and empty words
Fickle and inconsiderate
There one second and gone the next
Most loves fade quietly
Most love tiptoes away
You preferred to go out with a bang.


















The questions lie
On my tongue
Where were you?
What were you doing?
But my fear of you leaving
Overpowers me
Were you with her?
And I
Don’t dare ask.


















 

A friend once told me,
That people don’t live. They run.
And I want to know,
Is that why you told her you never liked me?
Were you trying to run?
Is that why I kept it unofficial,
I wanted to keep my escape route open?
People don’t run from something, or someone.
They run from their own emotions.
Like when I broke up with you after that final straw.
I didn’t run from you.
I ran from the like I felt for you.
People don’t live, they run.
What if I stop running?
Is that what killing yourself feels like?
Taking a long sip of water after a run,
Finishing a test in the last seconds,
Gulping down air, trying to restart your body.
Does death feel like freedom?
Is it the new beginning?
Or is it just another hell,
Waiting for its latest victim,
Waiting for its victim to drown?













She’s worth it
He said
Without hesitating
And
Without hesitating
I know she
Is all I want to be.


















Isn’t it funny how people
Believe in god
With absolute faith?
They don’t have to see Him. They believe.
Isn’t it funny how people
Dismiss mental illnesses
As pure fantasy?
They have ample proof. They close their eyes.
Isn’t it funny
how people
Are hypocrites?



















It started with that shooting star
Arcing over our heads
While I lay in tears
Because of something he said
You sat and wished faithfully
You wished to have me again
While I watched him turn my mind against me
And tears came pouring out
It was like I was in the middle of a waterfall
Falling
And you were trying to hold onto me
While he just jumped with me
I was drenched and screaming
He just held me close
He turned my words against me
And I lost my nerve
Four months later I came back
From the brink of hell
Someone new was waiting for me
He smiled and laughed
and ran away from the wreck I was
I never quite got over that
It hurt me like you did
all those months ago
It was like I was in the middle of a waterfall
Falling
Only this time
The water suffocated me
Till I drowned.







I can't do this anymore.
For the past year, I've been
running from prose, running
from my dream, running
towards poetry.
 
But now? It seems like it's time,
time to stop running, time
to face what I actually want 
to do, what I actually want to be.
 
I wrote poetry because for the 
last year, I just needed a way
to vent, I just needed a way to
say the things that couldn't
be said, I just needed to
be able to breathe.
 
I can breathe now. 
Ive been gulping down air for 
the past few weeks; I've been
airing my rooms; I've let my
skeletons out of the closet.
Now, all I want to do is be.
 
I know, I've covered pages 
with shitty metaphors about our love,
I've covered pages with my
scrawny handwriting, with my
tears and blood, with my story.
 
But my story no longer needs telling.
It's taking a break from being
poetic, it's taking a break from 
being broken.
 
My story needs to be.
My story doesn't need to be written down; 
it can't be written down when it
hasn't finished happening.
My story needs time to grow.




 
 
The room I'm in seems to be
slowly closing in on me, like,
these walls are moving towards me, like,
there is not enough air in this room 
for all of me, like, there is too much
of me, and too less of it. 
I feel like shrinking into myself, like
folding inwards, like cutting through
my bones just to make sure everyone
around me is comfortable. I feel
like taking more than one bite of 
anything is overstepping my boundaries, like
I don't exist in the same plane as everyone 
else, like I am lesser.


















 
 
I can still feel your hand pressed
against the small of my back, 
I can still feel your lips whispering 
along my collarbone, I can still feel 
you in every step I take, in every
word I say; I thought you were gone.
I was wrong, because when people
leave, they aren't supposed to leave 
imprints of them in every inch of my
skin, they aren't supposed to conveniently
leave their things in my bedroom, in 
my heart, on my body.
I thought I was over this, but
I'm obviously not- yesterday, mid-moan 
I groaned your name at a stranger 
and that isn't even the worst of it-
I mean, what do I need to do to get rid 
of this, of you, of us? 
You left more than a year back, but
here you are at my neck, in my house,
on my bed. Just leave me alone,
I'm enough of a wreck without 
memories of you fucking me 
crowding my brain, just leave-
You are not wanted here. Or 
atleast, I do not want you
to be wanted here.











 
 
with RB
Every word you say seems to
trickle down my spine and nestle
in the small of my back - I tingle
when I think of you. Every word
you say seems to be a world in
itself, a world in which I am constantly
lost in.
Every word you say seems to 
Shatter me like a hurricane; you leave me broken yet whole
Every word you say leaves an impact that will never erase; the thought of us makes me long for the truth.
Every word you say is both my salvation and my undoing and I can't
seem to get enough
 


















 
 
The blue of 
sky is unlike
others- it isn't 
meant to be 
drowned nor
drunk, but 
instead it's 
meant to
blow you away




 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The poems I used to write
were palatable. They were
mangoes in the summer,
they were your hands clutching 
my waist, they were 
soft. Shy. Vulnerable.
Now, every word I write feels
like it's being burnt out of
me. Every poem I write is
trying it's best to be what
a poem should be, it's
trying to be more than it 
can- What if I'm too soft for 
this? Someone told me that
to write well, I would need
to shed some blood, I 
would need to live a fuller
life, what do I do when my
life feels like river in flood-
brimming, brimming, brimming,
I can barely keep up.
Yet, I still can't write. 
What do I need to
do to shed some blood?
What do I need to do
to write about
something real?
I'm brimming, brimming,
brimming and all I have
to tide me over is your 
voice- how do I make
poems from barely
anything? How do 
I go back to what I
used to create- soft.
real. vulnerable. 
How do I translate
my thoughts 
into words?





 
 
So life doles out pain like it's 
spare change and we're beggars-
arms outstretched, hoping that
this offering isn't as bad 
as the previous one, but we 
never stop taking, never stop 
looking, because life distributes
hope as a scattered surprise,
and we all know that even 
one second of this pure
unfiltered joy is worth it, worth
the hurdles, the barriers, the
hurt, we know that even though
happiness might be hard to find,
we have to keep searching


















 
The sky above me is
the perfect shade of sweet 
longing and it almost
whispers pretty little 
epiphanies to me 
till it doesn't at all,
instead all I'm left with
is a feeling of what
could've been if the sky 
could speak, what could've been
 if I was floating high 
above this wreck of a 
world- we ruined all of 
it  long before we thought,
Before we realised 
what we were doing. We
looked at this mess, called it 
progress. Called it love. Called 
it good. Now, this grey sky 
doesn't look like a true
fantasy above the 
city, it looks like pain.
 Like suffering. Like the 
world is slowly drowning
because of us, because
 of our foolish petty
ambition. What good is 
a world where the trees don't 
talk and only whimper 
in fear? What good is a 
world where we look for art 
while cutting it down, while 
using it and throwing 
it away like a cheap 
doll? The world was just a 
one night stand to us but 
now, dawn is beckoning 
and we're throwing it back 
on the streets wearing not 
a stitch. The sky above 
me is the perfect shade 
of longing and till now, 
I thought it was mimicking 
what I felt but now it 
seems obvious that the 
sky is longing for its 
past when I didn't exist-
It's longing for a time 
where we left it alone.
 
 
Dear soul, 
I'm sorry that this body isn't all what it's supposed to be, sorry that's it's all angles and hollow spaces when all you wanted was more.
But right now, it's all I have. 
All we have.
Everything seems shaky right now. My anxiety flares up like a stranger I should recognise and lately, it's been harder to get away from. It's been sticking in my throat and that's why I haven't been speaking up that often. 
A while back, someone asked me if I felt trapped and I said I didn't, but now I'm not so sure. This room seems to be caving in on me at the best of times. And I know, I'm melodramatic at best, but this house is just a larger version of the body I'm in, that is, this house is just another cage. 
The truth is, I'm exhausted soul.
Exhausted of sitting here, talking to my own soul because I don't know who else to say this to. 
Talking to my own heart in a bid to get it to face it's fears.
I'm exhausted.
Dear soul, 
You can't expect a slate to be clean until you wipe it. So rest. 
Tomorrow is a new day.
















 
 
There's this habit that 
follows me all day long, watches
me trip over my own tongue
till the only words that
can be heard are the ones I'm
regurgitating from the past, 
you see, I've always had
trouble adapting so sometimes
I just dont, I just carry 
home around till nostalgia is
is a noose around my foolish
neck, you see, I turned longing
into a lifestyle and now I'm 
stuck in a rendition of a past
I'm ready to forget, but 
there's this habit that 
follows me all day long, and
I don't think I'm strong enough
to ask it to leave, don't think
I'm strong enough to
douse it in gasoline, don't
think I'm strong enough
to leave it in the past.













 
 
 
Not sure what to write about you,
 
a powder blue boy,
 
you,
 
lighting up a lilac sky,
 
you,
 
dancing your way through this grey dawn,
 
you.
 
I guess I ran out of words a while back,
 
guess I had just forgotten what 
 
twisted tongues and
 
a knotted heart felt like- 
 
sun shining
 
thunder crashing;
 
contradictions.
 
Guess I should've known;
 
It's always hard to
 
describe something I've
 
never quite let go of, 
 
that despite my 
 
best efforts always feels 
 
like I'm coming 
 
full circle, like
 
coming home.


 
 
Statistics are running through
 
my head and everywhere I 
 
turn I see the possibility of 
 
something turning to nothing,
 
of love turning to indifference,
 
of you just being another 
 
name in a joke twenty years 
 
from now- whats the point? 
 
What's the point of tasting 
 
something just to spit it out,
 
of going to sea but not being 
 
able to see the waves, of seeing
 
into everyone's souls, except yours?
 
I guess what I'm trying to
 
say is, I spent too many years 
 
trying to forget the bitter I was,
 
and I'm not sure I can withstand 
 
the venom coursing through 
 
my veins again, not sure I 
 
want to relive a situation
 
I've messed up more than once.




 
There's a Me in a different universe who's got her shit together, who doesn't cry at the sight of cigarettes, who doesn't run away from everything good. 
 
A Me who's a little bit more badass, a Me who parties at night and doesn't do homework, a Me that hasn't tasted anxiety for so long she doesn't remember it.
 
There's a Me in another universe who's written the book she keeps talking about. She chases all the things I've been hiding from. 
 
Maybe the way I exist somewhere is less soft, more knife. Less angles, more curve. Maybe a Me manages to sleep without clawing herself. 
 
There is, maybe, another Me in another universe, and there are, maybe, many versions of me scattered across the stars. And no matter where they are,
 
I hope they're all doing alright

















 
 
 

Maybe it's time to give up.
 
Maybe now, now is the
 
time to slowly melt away,
 
now is the time to leave 
 
this place with my dignity 
 
intact, now is the time to
 
disappear before I crack
 
under their gazes, maybe
 
I need to run. 
 
Run from these people
 
who don't know me at 
 
all, these people who 
 
would watch my 
 
soul wilt before they 
 
took off their masks, 
 
these people who unzip
 
their humanity like it's a
 
dress gone out of style-
 
I can't stay. 
 
Anything is better than this,
 
whether I leave in flames
 
or in a box; any grave
 
would be easier to
 
breathe in, any 
 
death would be easier 
 
than this, because all 
 
sins are pardoned when
 
your body is decaying;
 
I need to leave. 
 
So I guess this is my 
 
whisper into the void, my
 
wave goodbye, because once 
 
I'm gone, all I want to leave
 
behind is the feeling of grace 
 
as it’s chanted to the skies.









 
 
I wear my vulnerability like a knife,
 
just sharp enough to cut you, just 
 
soft enough to console me-
 
I burn whole buildings while
 
sobbing my eyes out; this is not
 
a sad story, this is a battle cry- I've 
 
been yelling to the world as long
 
as I can remember but no one
 
ever answers; I've been waiting
 
for someone to notice me
 
standing here but people just 
 
walk past. This isn't a lament,
 
simply an observation, simply
 
a quiet whisper in a crowded bar- 
 
So, feel free to ignore it. 
 
Enough people already have.

















 
 
She was a wisp of air,
hovering around me like a 
permanent reminder of 
living a life when you're
someone like me, when
you're barely getting by, 
when all you want to do
is transfer your soul to
a body that doesn't jut out
in the wrong places, a body
that other people like.
I mean, sometimes she's 
sweet, in the way that 
people are when they've 
seen too much suffering
or when they realise that
they have a idea of love
so skewed that it tastes
like abuse sprinkled with
love, like sadness normalised.
Sometimes, sometimes
she's mad and then you 
wonder when and where you
went wrong, when and 
where she was born, when
and where your skin started
to feel like it was being 
stretched over your bones;
a body too small to
accomodate your soul.
But I knew she's there 
because of the feeling that
permeates every room she 
walks into, like a wind of
inadequacy that suddenly 
wafts into every room y
you're in; I know she's there
because she's that person
made to make you realise
how wrong you were about 
everything you wished for.




 
 
You build your life around a tale
never meant to be, 
cry foul when it doesn't prevail,
and then, try not to return to reality.
 
I mean, what were you expecting?
Remember last time, did you do no reflecting? 
 
You watch your lover (hopefully) walk away,
and I watch you,
while standing alone holding a bouquet.
I never thought a love could go this askew.
 
But here I am,
believing in the same sham.
 
Were you the naive one, or was I,
for blindly following you from boy to boy?
Now, when you pass by
I'll know better (hopefully); I won't be your toy. 















 
 
Advice stands on its own merit, and
 
advice makes you pause when 
 
you're ready to leave, and advice
 
tells you when and where to meet it,
 
but none of this matters when
 
advice tells you to not mention
 
your fluttering heartbeat.






















 
I can barely breathe.
The smoke overpowers it
all- even the sun.























 
 
 
Art was supposed to be beautiful. 
 
Art wasn't supposed to make 
 
me feel like everyone was looking 
 
at me, like there were tears dripping
 
down my cheeks, like the pain
 
I felt had been ripped out of my chest 
 
and onto the canvas, like the artist
 
had seen into my bitter, pained soul.
 
I never knew art could make me 
 
feel like this, like the world might
 
fall any second, like atlas couldn't
 
hold us up any longer, like despite
 
everything that had occurred, 
 
I would be okay.


















 
 
It was never about the 
 
whispers that spread like
 
wildfire, no, it was about
 
the insinuations that dug
 
me an early grave, the 
 
allegations that cut me
 
like, the blame that 
 
bloomed till it was all I 
 
could see, all I could think
 
about, all I could feel. 
 
I guess it was about the hurt
 
I felt, like little pinpricks
 
that blossomed into gashes,
 
It, all of it, was about how
 
I could draw parallels from
 
every inconsequential word
 
I ever heard uttered till I 
 
was just a dried husk of 
 
the person I once was, 
 
drained by all the effort it
 
took to defend myself,
 
over and over, 
 
against myself.














 
I always thought there 
 
would be a limit to this love. 
 
What I mean is that I 
 
thought we were a ticking
 
time bomb, just waiting
 
to explode- but we're not.
 
We're not an explosion, or
 
a wreck or any other violent
 
metaphor I can think of. 
 
And we're not the ocean, or 
 
stars; nor the moon or 
 
the sun- we just are. 
 
We don't need metaphors 
 
to see that this means 
 
something, and we don't need 
 
sweet little nothing's to 
 
assure us of our survival, 
 
because we're doing okay, and
 
we don't need to explain it 
 
to everyone else. But, I always 
 
thought there would be a
 
limit to this love, and you,
 
you proved me wrong. 
 
We proved me wrong.













 
 
You spread all over my heart 
 
like it was a blank canvas, and
 
you were its paint. You 
 
spilled over its edges till 
 
it wasn't only my heart you 
 
claimed but every inch of
 
my skin as well, and 
 
now you've invaded my 
 
thoughts- all of me is 
 
coloured you. 




















 
 
Tentacles of misinterpretation cling
 
to my body, draining me of 
 
all my sense till I am just a dry
 
husk of a person. Immersed in
 
this confusion, I can feel myself
 
wilting. Drying. Drooping. I can feel
 
myself losing any grip I had on 
 
reality till I am in a red universe 
 
where everything shouts your name
 
at me; I am on my knees. I no
 
longer know what brought me
 
to this place where everything 
 
is streaked orange, and I no longer 
 
remember what I did to be 
 
sentenced to this prison, but all
 
that really strikes me now is the 
 
irony of misinterpretation as I 
 
scream at this red sky- All I know
 
now is that I want to leave.
















 
Ripples of turquoise snake through the earth with 
highlights of white, framed by white pebbles, much
smoother than most people's lies, and above,
shades of deodar and fir line every/
hill creating a subtly alive painting. 
In the midst of this all is much more than 
a painting could ever show, like how the
river's roar replaces the usual loud/
city bustle I hear, and how the air/
seems to almost sparkle with moisture. The 
trees seem to be whispering their secrets 
with every change in the wind even as 
the insects hum to themselves and the fish 
dance just below the surface of the bright
glistening water; I am not meant to/
witness this. Places like these aren't meant to 
be seen by mere humans, they cater to
much more important beings, and every 
step I take here feels like sacrilege, yes, 
every step seems to be something this small 
piece of the world gifts me, every step shows 
me just how small everything is compared 
tothe thrum of the earth, compared to the 
song of the skies, compared to nature in 
its full glory- people can't come close to 
achieving such perfection, how could they?











 
 
 
Blood stains her fingertips,
 
her consciousness is 
 
unable to keep
 
up with the mess 
 
that she is today and
 
she never is quite 
 
sure which side she's on, so
 
she bleeds from both;
 
her hands are stained. 
 
she doesn't know how 
 
to not leave a mark behind




















 
Obscurity is a scourge 
 
during the cover of night,
 
but it burns under the 
 
glare of day, leaving behind
 
only a memory of its 
 
existence, leaving behind
 
only the very core of its
 
being- truth. 
 
Truth does not waver,
 
it stands true in its 
 
conviction, even in the 
 
face of flickering love.
 
Because love can flicker
 
and dance and hide, but
 
truth stands tall- a pillar
 
waiting for its turn in 
 
this dying light.

















 
J'ai pensé à you quand
j'ai regardé la ciel, car tu
es plus beaux que les
étoiles cette lumieré la ciel























 
 
with RB
Every time I match your eyes,
I feel a chill down my soul,
Like all of me protests but then lets
go- trying to resist you is a death 
wish, trying to resist you is a
foolish gamble I don't want to take.
 
Every time we meet,
I feel I have no control,
Like I'm trapped in a cage, like
I'm just a beast pleading to be free.
This love has erased the best
parts of me; I am an empty shell.
 
Every time I see your smile,
I'm being drawn in by your gravity, 
like I'm spiralling into madness-
Everything is calm, but us.
Everything is beautiful, but us.
Everything is relative, but us
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Today, spirals of dust seemed to 
 
rise with every step I took and every
 
time I spoke - my breath blew away
 
before I could finish my sentence; 
 
The wind seemed to almost 
 
follow me across this dreary town, 
 
like it was trying to emulate the 
 
lightness with which I walked, like
 
it was trying to understand how 
 
I was better at floating away, better
 
at dissipating, better at shaking the
 
world than it could ever be. 
 



















 
As I walk, all I can think about
 
is my hair, my dress, my dreams- 
 
all ruined by the Aurai, a single 
 
sweep of their hands can send 
 
this godforsaken wind, this chilly 
 
air, this breeze that seems hell-bent
 
on ruining my day; All I wanted to 
 
do was take a walk without being 
 
pursued by the air, all I wanted to
 
do was be able to speak without
 
words being snatched out of my 
 
mouth, but I guess that's not 
 
happening today, I guess, I just
 
need to let this wind run its course.


















 
 
Lanterns line every wall
of these dark depths and 
their dancing flames create 
eerie shadows- I could 
percieve nothing. With 
hollow eyes, a sunken heart
and more than one knife 
strapped to my back, I 
descending further into
the well hoping, nay, praying
that my woman's reason,
that my gut feeling, that my
heart had not led me astray,
and that's when I slipped,
tethered only by a thin rope 
to the world above; I knew I
would not survive. I
looked above at the little 
glimmer of the sky and I 
knew that slowly the day 
would turn to night, my
body would turn to rot, my
heart would turn to stone- 
I cut the rope. 
As I plummeted, my
woman's reason told me 
that I had made the right 
decision and I fell 
peacefully, closing my eyes
after I caught a last glimmer 
of the sky. The lanterns kept
burning till they too were 
just a distant memory, and
as the darkness closed in 
on me, I gave myself up to
it, and let myself believe
that even peace, villains
could obtain; my skull
cracked on impact I believe, 
my severed lips,crooked
teeth and unnatural figure
lay there- nobody would 
miss me. But, atleast
I had peace. Atleast, I no
longer had to survive.


 
 
This is the potential poem,
the poem that says everything I'm to afraid to.
This is the 'we could be something' poem,
the poem that you'll never read.
 
This is the 'I want to kiss you' poem,
The 'I want to date you' poem,
The 'I'm afraid of actually being with you' poem,
The 'I love the fact that you're a genius' poem
 
This is the poem that ignores the bad things,
The poem that doesn't tell you about me hating how you are sometimes.
This is the potential poem,
the poem that'll never reach you.


















 
 
Fuck.
Today, when I looked at you, 
It was like I jumped from a cliff, no
it was like someone pushed me.
It was like there was this force leading me to the water,
leading me to you.
As I fell,(for what seemed like
the nth time; let's not lie, I've fallen
for your eyes before)
I could hear the
whistling air, I could smell
the salty sea, I could envision
my impending death.
I felt no remorse, because
at the end of the day
I didn't try to save myself.
So I guess it was my fault,
for not caring enough (about
myself), I guess I should've
known that jumping into
the sea would leave me 
only with one gift, a kiss of
death. I guess imagining you
as the sea should've been 
my first warning since I never 
learnt to swim, I guess I was stupid.
But now here I am, diving
towards the great known,
diving towards certain death,
yet I'm smiling.
I'm smiling because no matter how
poisonous you are, I'm
still eagerly taking you in,
I'm still ready to die.
And I guess thats where the 
problem started, don't you agree?
The problem was never you,
it was me. It was me, with my 
self destructive tendencies, me
with my carefully constructed
solitude, me, trying to be poetry.
And I guess today, diving towards
my death, diving towards
an ocean, I finally made it.
I finally changed into the written 
word, I was finally good enough 
to write about.
 
 
 
 
If this was the end, 
wouldn't it be funny?
Wouldn't it be funny if this,
this is how we part ways?
I always thought we would
separate because of something
more real, something more tangible.
I never thought it wouldn't work because of our thoughts,
I never imagined that my worries would pile up,
I never imagined this relationship 
would seem like a dump yard for all our delusions.
 
If this was the end,
wouldn't it be funny?
Wouldn't it be funny, if you were
right all along? Remember when 
we first met, you told your best friend,
that day in the dorm, that my thoughts would overwhelm me,
and since you couldn't handle the the explosion that was 
hurtling towards me, you were never going to be with me.
And then, you took that risk and I guess, 
it didn't pay off because here we are.
 
Here we are, 
you've been charred to a crisp and 
I've been revelling in the fire, I've been
feeding my thoughts, I've been igniting your bones, 
I've been waiting for this to end since the moment it started.
I just didn't realise that my thoughts would be the cause. 
I always thought yours would be.
But I guess this proved that birds of feather flock together,
that when you rub two stones you create frictions,
that when two bank robbers meets, they're probably going to rob a bank,
I guess this was our bank.
I guess we set it on fire.
I guess you suffered more.
I'm still not sorry, because
you're the one who took that risk,
You're the one who knew how this would end from the start.
I never did.
Isn't it funny how this is the end? 
Isn't it funny that no matter how many explosions we created,
we ended up being the bombs? 
Isn't in funny that we both got burnt?
Isn't it funny that I don't care?
Isn't it funny, 
how this is the end?
 
 
 
 
 

Please don't say you like me,
because you don't. You like
the person you think I am,
the person you wish I was,
the person I don't plan on being.
Stop trying to make this work,
it's never going to. I want you to
know that I never opened that 
link to your blog till today because
honestly, I didn't care. But woah,
how was I supposed to 
know that you turned us into poetry?
How was I supposed to know that
you thought we were worth poetry?
We're not. 
Go write about books or social issues, go write
about Taylor Swift. Shit, I guess you 
don't want to 
write about her, you want to *be* her,
I mean, isn't this what she gets paid for?
I mean, she's fine and all but shit, 
I didn't want you to be like *her*.
I don't want you to write about
our non existing relationship, even
though I should've seen this 
coming. I would have never said
we have potential if this is 
what I thought would happen,
I would never have said yes.
I mean, you're a great person and
its really nice that we're kind of friends,
and it's even nicer to have you like me,
but damn. The people who read your blog 
know more about you than I do,
and I think that speaks volumes.
So stop liking me, because 
honestly I never planned for it
to work. For the right person, I 
would have made the time, I 
would have been less distant.
You're not the right person.
I know you think we have something special, but I don't know,
I haven't felt it.
I don't know, it's getting weird now. 
Stop writing about me,
stop liking me, and please
stop believing I'm a good person.
I have been a wreck for half my
life and yes, you helped, but you
don't know most of it, you
don't know how fickle I am, you
don't know how angry I am, you
don't know anything.
Mostly, you don't know how much 
I don't care about you, because I've
tried to be nice. But fuck, I can't
live with the fact that I'm your
Muse, so stop. Stop it all,
erase me from your life, I don't know, just don't make me think 
about it anymore. Cause I'm done,
so fuck you. I'm not the guy you
wrote about but I'm sure as hell
not the guy you told me I was, so
fuck you. Get over me. Get over yourself.
