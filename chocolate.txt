      1 c  Water
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
      3 tb Cocoa
    1/2 c  Buttermilk
      3    Eggs
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Vanilla extract
           *****icing*****

      2 tb Cocoa
      6 tb Milk
      1 ts Vanilla
      1    Powdered sugar

      Title: Absolutely Deep Dark Chocolate Fudge Biscuits
 Categories: Chocolate, Low-fat/low, Cookie
      Yield: 36 servings
 
  7 1/2 oz All-purpose flour
      2 oz Cocoa powder
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Salt
      8 oz Chocolate; broken in 16 pcs
      4 oz Unsweetened chocolate;
           -broken in 8 pcs
     12 oz Light brown sugar
      6 oz Unsalted butter
      3    Eggs
      1 ts Vanilla
  1 1/2 lb Chocolate chips
 
  Recipe by: Paul Vincent <KNDUSR18@MSMAIL-GATEWAY.UNIVERSITY-CENTRAL- EN
  [Note: Instead of the unsweetened chocolate, I just used an extra 4ozs of
  plain chocolate, and got perfect results. I think as long as you're using
  *really* good plain chocolate, say at least 55% cocoa solids, it doesn't
  really matter!]
  
  Preheat the oven to 325F / 170C / Gas 3.
  
  Sift together the flour, cocoa powder, bicarbonate of soda, and salt. Set
  aside.
  
  Heat 1 inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium
  heat. Place the plain and the unsweetened chocolates in the top half of the
  double boiler. Tightly cover the top with cling film and allow to heat for
  12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir until smooth. Keep at room
  temperature until needed.
  
  Place the soft light brown sugar and butter in the bowl of an electric
  mixer fitted with a paddle. Beat on medium for 1 minute. Scrape down the
  bowl and beat on high for an additional 30 seconds. Scrape down the bowl.
  Add the eggs, one at a time, while beating on medium, and stopping to
  scrape down the bowl after incorporating each addition. Add the vanilla
  essence and beat on medium for 30 seconds. Add the melted chocolate and
  beat on low for 10 seconds more. Scrape down the bowl and beat for an
  additional 30 seconds. Add the sifted flour, cocoa powder, bicarbonate of
  soda, and salt, and the chocolate chips, and beat on low until thoroughly
  combined - about 20 to 30 seconds. Remove the bowl from the mixer and mix
  thoroughly with a rubber spatula.
  
  Portion 6 to 8 biscuits per baking sheet by dropping 2 level tablespoons of
  batter per biscuit onto each of 2 non-stick baking sheets. Place the
  biscuits on the top and middle shelves of the preheated oven and bake for
  18 to 22 minutes, rotating the sheets from top to bottom about halfway
  through the baking time. Allow the biscuits to cool for 5 to 6 minutes on
  the baking sheets. Transfer the biscuits to a cooling rack to thoroughly
  cool before storing in a sealed plastic container. Repeat this procedure
  until all the biscuits have been baked.
  
  Makes 3 to 3.5 dozen biscuits

           CHOCOLATE CRUMB CRUST
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
      4 tb Butter (1/2 stick),melted
      3 c  Chocolate-wafer crumbs
           H
           FILLING
    3/4 c  Sugar
      3    Eggs
  1 1/2 lb Cream cheese, softened
      1 c  Semi-sweet chocolate chips,
           -melted and cooled
      2 tb Unsweetened cocoa powder
      2 ts Instant espresso powder,
           -dissolved in 1 tsp boiling
           -water
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      3 c  Sour cream
      4 tb Butter (1/2 stick),melted
           H
    1/2 c  Heavy cream, whipped
      6    Candied violets, for garnish
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
    To make the crust, mix all the ingredients with a fork until well
  blended.  Pour into a 10-inch springform pan, and press the crumbs
  firmly against the sides with your hands, working them up the pan as
  far as possible.  Press a thin layer of crumbs on the bottom of the
  pan.  Chill while you make the filling.
    Cream the sugar and eggs in a large mixing bowl.  Stir in the cream
  cheese, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing well after each addition.
  Stir in the melted chocolate and the rest of the ingredients in the
  order given, except the cream and the violets.  Mix well, and pour
  into the chilled crust.
    Bake cake for 50 to 60 minutes.  The cake will jiggle in the middle
  when moved and look underdone, but it will solidify as it cools.  Let
  it sit for 30 minutes after taking it from the oven, then refrigerate
  for 3 to 4 hours or overnight before unmolding.
    Decorate with small mounds of whipped cream dropped on top by the
  teaspoonful or piped on in rosettes, and add candied violets, if
  using. Serve with a bowl of extra whipped cream, if desired.
  
  CANDIED VIOLETS: Use only fresh, perfect blossoms.  Rinse then well
  and pat dry.  With a tiny brush, paint the petals with a lightly
  beaten egg white, then sprinkle with extrafine sugar.  Lay the coated
  blossoms on a piece of wire mesh, such as a large strainer, placed
  over a piece of waxed paper.  Let dry for several hours at room
  temperature before storing in an airtight container.  These will keep
  indefinitely.

      1 tb (rounded) flour
    1/2 c  Butter
      1 tb Heavy cream
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 tb Milk
 
  Recipe by: Margo H. Tyler These cookies require precision timing and fast
  action but the results are worth the trouble. I make them for holidays and
  special occasions, but they are delicious anytime.
  
   Preheat oven to 350=F8. Butter and flour baking sheet.
  
   In a small, heavy pan, place all ingredients. Cook over low heat, stirring
  constantly until butter melts. Drop by teaspoonful: onto baking sheet (do
  not bake more than six at one time).
  
   Bake at 350 for 7-9 minutes. Cookies should be only slightly brown and
  still bubbling at the center. Let cool only for a minute or so until the
  edge is firm enough to lift with a thin spatula Then, working quickly, lift
  cookies and turn them top side down onto paper towels. Roll over the handle
  of a wooden spoon to get a cylinder shape and let cool until crisp.
  
   Use a fresh cookie sheet for each baking to avoid cookies sticking on
  sheet. If cookies get too firm to roll over the spoon handle, place back in
  the oven for a few moments.
  
   Store cookies in an airtight cookie jar or tin. They will keep for a long
  time, and can be made well ahead of the holiday season.
  
   Variations: These cookies also can be left flat-make them smaller if you
  do that; however, they don't have the flair of the rolled lacy effect. Or
  roll ends of cooled cookies in melted chocolate.

      Title: Amaretto Chocolate Cheesecake
 Categories: Cheesecake
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
-----------------------------------CRUST-----------------------------------
      7 oz Amaretti (see note)
      2 T  Granulated sugar
      5 T  Sweet butter
      1 oz Chocolate, unsweetened
           -(1 square)

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      6 oz Chocolate, semisweet
      7 oz Amaretti
      4 oz Almond paste
    1/3 c  Amaretto liqueur
    1/4 c  Sugar, granulated
  1 1/2 lb Cream cheese
           -(room temperature)
      4 lg Eggs
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
 
  MAKE CRUST:  Butter the sides only (not the bottom) of a 9-inch spring-form
  pan (about 2 1/2 to 3 inches deep).  Grind the Amaretti very fine in a food
  processor or blender.  Mix with sugar in a mixing bowl.
  
  Melt the chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler, stirring
  occasionally.  Add the melted mixture to the Amaretti crumbs and sugar and
  mix thoroughly. (Don't wash the double boiler; you'll be using it again in
  a minute.)
  
  Turn the mixture into the prepared pan.  With your fingers, distribute it
  evenly over the bottom and press it down into a very firm, compact layer.
  Refrigerate while you prepare the filling.
  
  MAKE FILLING:  Adjust rack 1/3 up from the bottom of the oven and preheat
  to 350 degrees F. Partially melt chocolate in the top of a double boiler,
  then uncover and stir until completely melted. Remove the top of the double
  boiler and set aside to cool.
  
  Break the Amaretti coarsely into a bowl and set aside.  Cut the almond
  paste into small pieces, and beat on low speed with an electric mixer,
  while gradually adding the Amaretto liqueur. Beat until thoroughly mixed
  and set aside.
  
  Beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer until smooth.  Add the sugar
  and beat until smooth again. Add the almond paste-Amaretto mixture and beat
  until thoroughly mixed. Add the melted chocolate and beat well again. Add
  the eggs one at a time, beating at low speed until they are incorporated
  after each addition. Add the heavy cream and beat until smooth. Add the
  coarsely broken Amaretti and stir gently only to mix.
  
  Turn into the prepared pan, pouring the mixture over the bottom crust.
  Rotate the pan gently to level the batter. (Don't worry if the mixture
  comes almost to the top; it won't run over.)
  
  Bake 45 minutes.  It will seem soft and not done, but don't bake any more;
  it will become firm when chilled. The top of the cake is supposed to look
  bumpy because of the large chunks of Amaretti. Let cool completely at room
  temperature, then carefully remove the sides of the pan and refrigerate the
  cake (still on the bottom of the pan) for 4 to 6 hours, or overnight.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  This is adapted from Maida Heatter's "Book of Great Chocolate Desserts,"
  (Knopf 1980).  It won me a blue ribbon at the Martha's Vineyard
  Agricultural Exhibition and Fair in 1983. If you ever find yourself in
  front of a firing squad, this makes an unbeatable last request.
  
  *  Amaretti are Italian almond-flavored wafer cookies.  They are usually
  sold in metal tins with the wafers wrapped in packages of two inside the
  tin. You can also buy Amarettini, which are the same flavor but much
  smaller and not individually wrapped. Since you're going to grind some of

      Title: Angel Fudge
 Categories: Candy
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      2 c  Sugar
      8 tb Hershey's® chocolate syrup
      1 c  Milk
      1 tb Butter
      1 ts Vanilla
      1 sm Can marshmallow whip
 
  Recipe by: Hershey's 'Recipe Book', 1930
  Place the sugar, chocolate syrup and milk in a deep kettle and
  stir until the ingredients are well blended.  Boil without
  stirring until the mixture will form a soft ball when dropped
  into cold water.  Remove from fire and add the butter, vanilla,
  and marshmallow whip and allow to stand until the mixture has
  cooled to lukewarm.   Then beat until creamy and pour into
  buttered tins.  Cut into squares.
  
       That's it!  No reference to size of "tins."  I suppose
  marshmallow whip would be equivalent to marshmallow topping. . .

      Title: Aunty Betty's Bombe
 Categories: Dessert
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 c  Double cream
    1/3 c  Sugar
      4 T  Water
      6 oz Chocolate, plain
      3    Egg yolks
 
  Whisk 1/2 of the cream until stiff and spread it around the edges of a
  large bowl. Freeze for 1/2 to 1 hour.
  
  Dissolve the sugar in the water, bring to the boil and simmer for 3 minutes
  until syrupy.  Meanwhile, break chocolate into blender or warm bowl.
  
  Pour the hot sugar syrup onto the chocolate and blend or whisk until the
  chocolate has all melted.  Add the egg yolks and mix the whole lot
  thoroughly.
  
  Whisk the remaining cream into soft peaks and fold gently into the
  chocolate mixture. Pour into the centre of the frozen cream and freeze for
  several hours until solid. Cover when fully frozen.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A high-cholesterol chocolate dessert -- This recipe comes from a
  friend's aunt. It always seems to taste wonderful no matter how sloppily I
  measure things. Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  *  Although the recipe "serves 4-6," two people will happily eat the whole
  thing.
  
  *  The outside is frozen solid, so you may find a fork useful for breaking
  your portion into pieces without showering fellow diners with fragments. It
  could be served in small portions, but don't count on having any left over.
  
  *  Double cream has more than 45 percent butterfat.  It is difficult to
  find cream in North America that is richer than whipping cream, which is
  typically 32 percent butterfat. If you can find heavy cream it is likely to
  be 36 percent. Use the richest cream you can find.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 3 hours cooling.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

  Recipe by: Rebecca Robbins McLane of San Francisco Preparation Time: 0:30
  INSTRUCTIONS: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Arrange 24 cupcake liners in
  muffin tins or liberally grease a cake/bundt pan. Blend together the cream
  cheese, eggs and 2/3 cup of the sugar in a large bowl. Stir in the
  chocolate chips. Sift the remaining sugar, the flour, cocoa, baking soda
  and salt into a mixing bowl. Stir in the water, oil, vinegar and vanilla;
  beat until smooth. Fill cupcake liners 1/3 full with the chocolate batter;
  spoon the cheese mixture on top. If using a cake or bundt pan, scrape the
  batter into the pan, then top with several layers of the cream cheese
  topping, spreading it thinly because it will sink in deeper after each
  application. Bake until the cakes test done -- 30 to 35 minutes for
  cupcakes, 40 to 45 minutes for cake. Let cool 10 minutes before turning out
  on wire racks to cool completely.

      Yield: 1 cake
 
      1 pk Betty Crocker Supermoist
           -Devil's Food cake mix
      6 oz Jello Instant Choc.Pudding
      8 oz Pkg. Sour Cream

    1/4 c  Oil
      3    Eggs
     12 oz Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips
      1    Jar Smuckers Hot Fudge.
 
  Mix together everything except the hot fudge.  The batter will be THICK.
  Spread into a well greased and floured bundt pan.  If you can still get
  Baker's Joy pan spray, that works the best.  Bake at 350 for one hour. Use
  the standard toothpick test for doneness.
  
  Turn cake out while still warm.  Top with hot fudge.  Fudge can be heated
  by removing the lid and sticking the whole jar in the microwave for a
  minute or two.
  
  DON'T SUBSTITUTE THE HOT FUDGE. Only the Smucker's is really sticky
  enough. The other brands just run off the cake.

      Title: Bo's Chocolate Chip Cheesecake
 Categories: Cheesecake
      Yield: 1 Cheesecake
 
     24 oz Cream cheese,
           -broken into pieces
      4    Eggs, separated
      2 T  Vanilla extract
           -(do not use artificial
           -vanilla)
      1 c  Sour cream
    1/4 c  Brown sugar,
           -or to taste
      1 lb Chocolate chips
      1 lb Graham cracker crumbs
    1/2 c  Butter, melted
 
  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
  
  PREPARE THE BATTER:  Place the egg yolks in a food processor for 5 seconds,
  then add the cream cheese and beat until smooth.  Add the brown sugar and
  vanilla and process for several minutes, or until the batter is very
  smooth. Beat the egg whites and fold into the cheese mixture. Set aside.
  
  PREPARE THE CRUST:  Soften butter and combine with graham cracker crumbs.
  Mix until fully blended, e.g. they will form a ball when squeezed in your
  hand or by a spoon. Pat the crust into the sides and bottom of a springform
  pan about 9 inches in diameter.
  
  Spread a generous layer of chips on the bottom of the pan, and then pour
  the batter into the pan. Add another generous layer of chips to the top of
  the cake.
  
  Place the filled pan into the preheated oven.  Baking time will vary from
  about 30 minutes to 2 hours.  Cooking time depends on whether you want a
  soft, gooey "New York" style cheesecake (shorter) to a fluffy
  "souffle"-like cheesecake (longer). The longer you cook it, the fluffier it
  gets.
  
  When the cake starts to rise like a souffle, start checking to see if it is
  done.  It will just about double in volume, and should not flow over the
  sides of the pan. If the cake shimmers like Jello when shaken, it is done.
  Alternatively, if a knife inserted comes out clean, the cake is overcooked:
  the knife should be very lightly coated with batter.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A truly decadent chocolate chip cheesecake -- This recipe came to me
  from a friend of mine, Bo (pronounced "boo") Ture Ahlberg, who would
  occasionally (read "whenever we could persuade him") bring it into work.
  Needless to say, it would be snarfed up immediately.
  
  *  Bo prefers to use Nestle Mini-Morsel chocolate chips.

      Title: Brownies
 Categories: Dessert
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      8 oz Chocolate, unsweetened
           -(8 squares)
    1/2 lb Butter
      5    Eggs
  2 1/2 c  Sugar
      1 T  Vanilla extract
  1 1/2 c  Flour
      2 c  Walnuts, coarsely
           -chopped (optional)
 
  Grease a 13x9 inch pan and pre-heat oven to 375 degrees F.  Melt the
  chocolate and the butter in the top of a double boiler over simmering
  water.  Whisk until smooth. Set aside to cool while beating eggs.
  
  Beat the eggs, sugar and vanilla at high speed for a full 10 minutes. Blend
  in the chocolate-and-butter mixture at low speed.  Add flour, beating just
  to blend. Stir in walnuts, if desired.
  
  Bake 30 to 35 minutes.  Do not overbake.  The brownies are done when a
  toothpick inserted into the center comes out slightly dirty.  Cool in pan,
  then cut into squares.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Serious chocolate brownies -- This is an adaptation of the "Scrumptious
  Brownies" recipe found on a box of Baker's unsweetened chocolate. I've
  reduced the amounts of sugar and flour from the original, which I find
  makes for a very fudgey brownie. Yield: 32 brownies.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking and cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: Castillian Hot Chocolate
 Categories: Drinks, Spanish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Cocoa (powdered),
           -unsweetened
      1 c  Sugar
      7 t  Cornstarch (cornflour)
    1/2 c  Water
      4 c  Milk
 
  Mix the cocoa and sugar together.
  
  Dissolve the cornstarch (cornflour) in the water and combine with the
  cocoa-sugar mixture in a medium-sized saucepan.  Stir this until it is a
  smooth paste.  Begin heating this mixture, continuously stirring it with a
  whisk.  Gradually pour in the milk.  Continue stirring as you bring it to a
  simmer.  Simmer, stirring often, for about 10 minutes. The cocoa is ready
  when it thickens and is glossy and smooth.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Thick, rich Spanish hot chocolate -- I first tasted this wonderful
  beverage while touring in northern Spain with a choir. It's not like any
  hot chocolate I've had anywhere else, and I was delighted to find a recipe
  in "The Vegetarian Epicure Book Two." It is the best hot chocolate in the
  world (at least to me.)
  
  *  The consistency of the finished product should resemble chocolate
  pudding that didn't quite set. If you halve this recipe, you'll get just
  the right amount for two large mug-fulls. This cocoa is especially
  fantastic when you dip churros into it (a churro is a sugary, deep-fried,
  doughnut-like stick, and if anyone wants to send out a recipe, I'd be most
  grateful).

           -before measuring)
      5 c  Rolled oats (oatmeal),
           -powdered finely
      1 t  Salt
      2 t  Baking soda
      2 t  Baking powder
     24 oz Chocolate chips
           -(being a purist,
           -I prefer Toll House
           -morsels)
      8 oz Chocolate bar,
           -finely grated
      3 c  Chopped nuts
           -(I prefer walnuts,
           -but use your favorite)
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Cream together the butter and the sugars.
  
  Sift together flour, oatmeal, salt, baking soda, baking powder and shredded
  chocolate bar.  Add eggs and vanilla to creamed sugar and butter, then mix
  all ingredients together. Mix chocolate chips and nuts into mixture.
  
  Drop by onto ungreased cookie sheet in small drops.  Bake 6 minutes or
  until done.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chocolate Chip Cookies like Mrs. Fields makes -- These cookies are a
  combination of oatmeal and chocolate chip.  They are very rich, but very
  tasty.  The recipe was obtained from a friend of a friend, who supposedly
  paid a large amount of money for it. However, the cookies do not taste
  exactly the same as the name brand. Yield: approximately 60.
  
  *  A blender works very well to powder the oats and the chocolate bar. The
  blender chops the oatmeal finer than a food processor.  The powdered
  chocolate bar should melt at the touch of your fingers.
  
  *  I prefer my cookies just barely done, so that they remain chewy. If you
  want to send your taste buds into heaven, butter the cookies as they come
  out of the oven (still hot), and eat them still warm with a glass of cold
  milk.
  
  *  Note that cocoa is not the same thing as a shredded chocolate bar. Note
  also that oatmeal is not the same thing as quick-cooking oats or instant
  oatmeal.  Oatmeal means "rolled oats," such as Quaker oats.

 Categories: Tortes
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      2 cn Cake flour
    3/4 c  Unsweetened cocoa powder
  1 1/4 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/2    Unsalted butter; softened
      1 c  Granulated sugar
    3/4 c  Light brown sugar; packed
      2 lg Eggs; room temperature
      1 tb Vanilla extract
  1 1/3 c  Strongly brewed coffee; room

------------------------CARAMELIZED HAZELNUTS & PRAL------------------------
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
    1/4 c  Water
     12    Hazelnuts <see note below> -
    3/4 c  Hazelnuts; toasted
 
  Recipe by: <lhroberts@aol.com> NOTE: Position a rack in the center of
  the oven and preheat to 350F. Spread the hazelnuts on a baking sheet
  and toast for 12-15 minutes, or until golden beneath the skins. Wrap
  the nuts in a clean towel and cool completely. Transfer the cooled
  hazelnuts to a large sieve and rub them back and forth to remove the
  loose skins.
  
  Make the chocolate butter cake: Position a rack in the center of the
  oven and preheat to 375F. Line the bottom of a 17 1/2x11 1/2 jelly
  roll pan with parchment or wax paper. Lightly spray the bottom and
  sides of the pan with nonstick cooking spray. In a medium bowl, whisk
  together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. Sift the
  flour mixture onto a piece of wax paper and set aside. In a 4 1/2 qt.
  bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, using a paddle attachment, beat
  the butter at medium-high speed for 1 minute, until creamy. While
  continuing to beat the butter, gradually add the granulated and brown
  sugars, stopping the machine and scraping down the side of the bowl
  as necessary. Beat the butter/sugar mixture at medium-high speed for
  2 minutes, until smooth. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, and the
  vanilla. Reduce the speed to low, and alternately add 1/3 of the
  reserved dry ingred. and 1/3 of the coffee. In 2 more batches,
  alternately add the remaining dry ingred. and coffee, scraping down
  the bowl as necessary. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and,
  using a metal cake spatula, smooth the batter evenly into the pan.
  Bake the cake for 25-28 min., until the sides just begin to pull away
  from the pan and the surface springs back when lightly touched. Cool
  the cake in the pan set on a wire rack for 10 min. Invert the cake
  onto a wire rack; carefully peel off the parchment paper and allow
  the cake to cool completely.
  
  Make the caramelized hazelnuts and praline: Lightly spray a baking
  sheet with nonstick cooking spray. In a small saucepan, combine the
  sugar and water. Cook over med. heat, stirring constantly, until the
  sugar dissolves. Increase the heat to medium-high and continue to
  cook without stirring for 4-6 min., until the syrup caramelizes.
  Immediately remove the pan from the heat. Add the 12 perfect
  hazelnuts to the caramel and toss to coat. With an oiled fork, remove
  each hazelnut, letting the excess caramel drip back into the pan, and
  place them at one end of the prepared baking sheet. Quickly stir the
  3/4 c. of hazelnuts into the remaining hot caramel. Pour the hazelnut
  praline onto the other end of the baking sheet. Cool the praline for
  30 min. until hard. Reserve the individual caramelized hazelnuts for
  decorating the cake. Coarsely chop the praline. In a food processor
  fitted with the metal chopping blade, process the praline for 35-45
  seconds until finely ground. Transfer the praline to a bowl and set
  aside.

  SEE Chocolate Hazelnut Mascarpone Torte w/Raspberries I first
  
  Make the framboise syrup: In a small saucepan, combine the water and
  sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon
  until the sugar dissolves. Stop stirring; raise the heat to
  medium-high and bring the syrup to a boil. Remove the pan from the
  heat and stir in the framboise liqueur and vanilla.
  
  Make the mascarpone cream filling: In a 4 1/2 qt. bowl of a heavy-duty
  electric mixer using the wire whip attachment, beat together the
  mascarpone cheese, sugar and framboise liqueur at medium speed until
  combined, about 1 minute. While continuing to beat the mixture,
  gradually add the heavy cream; increase the speed to medium-high and
  beat the mascarpone mixture until soft peaks form and the mixture is
  spreadable. Cover and refrigerate the cream until ready to use.
  
  Assemble the cake: Using a long serrated knife, cut the cake
  lengthwise into 3 long strips of equal width. Place 1 cake strip on a
  wire rack. Using a pastry brush, moisten the top of the chocolate
  cake strip with some of the framboise syrup. Using an offset metal
  cake spatula, spread 1/4 cup of the mascarpone cream over the
  moistened cake strip. Cover the cream-coated strip with a layer of
  raspberries, places stem-side down in even rows over the cake (this
  will take approx. 2 1/3 cups of raspberries). Scrape 1 1/2 cups of
  the mascarpone cream on top of the raspberries. Using a small offset
  metal spatula, smooth the cream into an even layer, allowing it to
  settle into the gaps in between the berries. Sprinkle 1/4 cup of the
  ground praline over the cream layer. Place a 2nd cake strip on top of
  the praline; repeat the layering process and top with the final cake
  strip. Reserve the remaining ground praline to garnish the sides of
  the cake. Spread the remaining mascarpone cream in a thin, even layer
  around the sides of the cake, filling in all the gaps. Place the wire
  rack with the cake on it in the refrigerator for 1 hour to set.
  
  Make the glaze: Place the chocolate in a med. bowl. In a small
  saucepan, bring the cream and corn syrup to a gentle boil. Pour the
  hot cream mixture over the chocolate. Let the mixture stand for 30
  seconds to melt the chocolate. Gently whisk until smooth. Allow the
  glaze to cool for 5 minutes.
  
  Glaze the cake: Remove the cake from the refrigerator and place the
  wire rack on a baking sheet. Pour the glaze over the cake, covering it
  completely. While the glaze is still wet, put the remaining ground
  praline around the sides of the cake. Refrigerate the cake for 5-10
  minutes, until the glaze is set. Garnish the top of the cake with the
  caramelized hazelnuts.

  Recipe by: webmaster@godiva.com * whipped to soft mound stage
  
  Make the Brazil nut-orange cups:
  
   1. Position a rack in the center of oven and preheat to 400 degrees F.
  Spread the Brazil nuts in a single layer on a baking sheet and roast for 10
  minutes. Transfer the nuts to a large kitchen towel and rub briskly to
  remove most of the skins. Open the towel and spread out the nuts to cool,
  discarding the paper skins.
  
   2. In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade,
  combine the peeled nuts and the sugar. Process for 30 to 45 seconds until
  finely ground. Add the flour and process for 30 seconds to combine. Add the
  melted butter and orange rind, and process for 20 to 30 seconds. Add the
  egg whites and process for 20 to 30 seconds, until blended.
  
   3. Because you must work quickly to prevent the cups from cooling and
  getting hard before you have molded them, bake only two cups at a time.
  Have 2 or more 6-ounce custard cups ready to use as molds.
   Spoon two tablespoons of batter for each cup on each half of the baking
  sheet. Using the back of the spoon. spread the batter for each cup into a
  thin 6-inch circle. Be careful not to leave any bare spots or there will be
  holes in the cups.
  
   4. Bake the cookies for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the cookies are evenly
  golden and the edges are slightly browned. Remove the sheet from the oven.
  Using a metal spatulas loosen the edges of one of the cookies and lift it
  off the baking sheet. Quickly press the cookie into one of the custard cups
  to form the cup shape.
   Immediately repeat the shaping process with the second cookie.
   Cool the cookies completely, and then gently lift them out of the molds.
  
   5. Repeat the above process with the remaining batter, making two cups at
  a time. Store the cups in an airtight container at room temperature as soon
  as they are completely cool.

  cornstarch, and cocoa powder until smooth. Whisk in the eggs and the yolks
  until blended.
  
   2. In a heavy, medium, noncorrosive saucepan, combine the remaining
  half-and-half, sugar, salt and orange zest. Cook over medium heat, stirring
  occasionally, until small bubbles form around the side of the pan.
  Gradually whisk one cup of the hot half-and-half mixture into the
  cornstarch/egg mixture until blended. Pour this mixture back into the
  saucepan. Continue cooking over medium heat, whisking constantly until the
  mixture starts to form bubbles.
   Continue stirring and allow the mixture to boil for 2 minutes.
  
   3. Remove the pan from the heat and gently stir in the chopped chocolate
  until smooth. Strain the pudding through a sieve into a bowl. Stir in the
  vanilla. Cover the surface of the pudding with plastic wrap. Refrigerate
  until well chilled. about 3 hours.

      Yield: 1 servings
 
           -the best jelly roll.  It's
           -based on a German specialty
           -cake that was
           -traditionally cooked on a

           -fire, another good reason
           -to be thankful for the
           -modeern technology!
 
  10 large eggs, yolk and whites separated
  3/4 C. regular unsalted stick butter or margarine (not spread, at
  room temperature)
  1 C. granulated sugar
  1 tsp. vanilla extract
  1 C. all-purpose flour
  1/3 C. cornstarch
  2 Tbl. unsweetened cocoa powder
  1 tsp. instant coffee powder (not granular)
  Large pinch salt
  FILLING:
  1# (2 2/3 C.) semisweet-chocolate chips
  1/2 C. regular unsalted stick butter or margarine (not spread)
  2 Tbl. water
  1/2 tsp instant coffee powder (not granular)
  BARK:
  3-4 ounces semisweet chocolate
  For garnish - Confectioners' sugar, whipped cream
  
  1.  Generously oil or grease a 15 1/2 X 10 1/4" jelly roll pan.
  2.  Beat egg yolks in large bowl with electric mixer about 8 minutes until
  thick and pale.  Beat in butter and 3/4 C. of the sugar for 3- 4 minutes
  until
  pale and fluffy.  Beat in vanilla until blended.
  3.  Mix flour, cornstarch, cocoa, coffee and salt.  Stir into egg mixture.
  4.  With clean beaters, beat egg whites in a large bowl until soft peaks
  form
  when beaters are lifted.  Sprinkle on remaining 1/4 C. sugar and continue
  beating until mixture forms firm peaks.  Stir a large spoon of the whites
  into
  the yolk mixture, then gently stir or fold in the remaining whites.
  5.  Measure batter, then divide in fourths.  Spread 1/4 of the batter in
  prepared pan.  Spread it as evenly as possible, covering the entire
  surface of
  pan.  Broil 5-6 inches from heat source for 1- 2 minutes, turning the pan
  as
  necessary to make sure the entire surface is firm and lightly browned.  A
  few
  light-brown speckles may appear, but don't let cake get crisp.
  6.  Remove from heat.  Run a knife around edges.  After sitting for about a
  minutes, cake should lift from pan.  Turn pan over and gently let cake
  drop on
  a sheet of waxed paper. (Pull gently at corner if cake seems to need
  additional help.) Grease pan again and make 3 more layers.
  7.  FILLING:  Put chocolate chips, butter and the 2 Tbl. of water in a pan
  over hot water.  Stir until melted and smooth (it should be easily
  spreadable,
  so add a bit more water as needed).  Stir in coffee.
  8.  TO ASSEMBLE:  Spread a very thin layer of filling (a scant 1/3 C.) over
  first cake layer.  Roll up tightly, starting from one short edge.  Spread
  another layer with filling.  Line up the rolled layer on top and roll up as
  tightly as possible.  Repeat with remaining 2 layers.  The resulting log
  should be a good 5" in diameter.  Place on serving platter.  Spread
  remaining
  filling over whol cake except one end.
  9. BARK:  Melt chocolate over hot water, stirring until smooth. Pour out
  on a
  smooth kitchen counter or marble slab.  Run a long flexible spatula back
  and
  forth over chocolate, smoothing it thin and working it just until it loses
  its
  gloss.  Allow chococlate to harden (it could take 10 minutes or so,
  depending
  on your kitchen temperature).  With edge of spatula or large chef's knife,
  angle into the chocolate and scrape along, turning up large rolls of
  chocolate
  in rough barklike sections.
  10.  Arrange over top of cake.  Let frosting harden.  (Cake can be
  refrigerated at this point.  Let stand a room temperature 1 hour before
  slicing.)
  11.  Just before serving, sprinkle cake lightly with confectioners' sugar.
  Serve with whipped cream.

    1/2 c  Sugar; or more
    1/2 c  Cocoa
      2 ts Flavoring  (raspberr
           -y,orange, or almond)
      2    Egg equivalent
    3/4 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
           Splash liquor; ie, chambord
           Semisweet chocolate;
           -melted;optional
 
  Recipe by: FF Mailing List  (Christel Reeve) Combine flour, sugar, cocoa,
  salt and baking baking powder.  Separately, mix flavoring and eggs.
  Combine.  Add splash of liquor or water as needed to have a sticky
  consistency.  If the mixture is too stiff, it won't spread out properly.
  
  Put this glob on a greased cookie sheet and arrange it into a log about 15
  inches long and 1 1/2 - 2" wide. Bake at 350 for 25 minutes. Remove from
  oven, let cool a few minutes, then slice diagonally into 1/2- 3/4" slices.
  I got 18 pieces from mine. Place the slices on their side and put back in
  the oven (300 degrees) for 15 minutes.  Turn over and cook another 10-15
  minutes.
  
  If you can afford the fat, a small drizzle of semisweet chocolate is
  wonderful on these when cooled. I used about 2 T. for all the cookies,
  which added about 6 g. fat to the recipe or 1/3 g. fat each one.

  Recipe by: Hershey's Cookbook, 1934
  Hi, All!   I just received a "new" 1934 Hershey's Cookbook. It has been
  fun just reading this book! When we think what our mothers and
  grandmothers had back in those days compared to what we have now!!! Don't
  think anybody would want to go back, although the times were much simpler.
  There are lots of good-sounding chocolate recipes in the book and I will
  post some.
  
   Heat oven to 400 deg. Place bread in lightly buttered 2-qt. casserole. In
  large mixer bowl, beat butter and sugar until well blended. Add evaporated
  milk, eggs, cocoa, vanilla, salt and cream of tartar. Beat on low speed
  until blended. Stir in raisins and 1/2 cup pecans. Pour mixture over
  bread, making sure bread is covered with mixture. Sprinkle coarsely
  chopped pecans over top, if desired.  Bake 45 to 50 min. (Place foil over
  top during last 10 minutes of baking.) or until top is browned. Serve warm
  with light cream. Serves 8.

      Title: Chocolate Brown Sugar Cookies
 Categories: Cookie
      Yield: 3 Dozen
 
    1/2 c  Brown sugar
    1/2 lb Butter
    1/3 c  Honey
      1 lg Egg
    1/2 t  Vanilla extract
           Flour (1.1 C --> glass
           -measuring cup filled
           -to the top)
    1/2 t  Baking soda
      1 c  Chocolate chips
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Cream together the butter and the brown
  sugar, add egg and vanilla. Mix well. Add honey.
  
  Measure flour and baking soda (I usually just mix the soda in with the
  flour.) Add flour and soda to batter a little at a time and mix. Add
  chocolate chips.
  
  Drop by spoonfuls onto an ungreased cookie sheet and bake for 5-8 minutes
  at 375 degrees F.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chocolate chip cookies with honey and brown sugar.
  
  *  For those of you who like your cookies warm!  I always make up only
  enough to eat, and store the batter in the fridge.
  
  *  You can substitute margarine for the butter if you want.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy, though creaming butter and sugar without a food
  processor is tedious.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 10 minutes cooking and cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: Chocolate Caramel Truffles
 Categories: Chocolate, Godiva, Candy
      Yield: 20 servings
 
           Caramel:
    1/2 c  Plus 2 tablespoons gran; ula
           -ted sugar
    1/4 c  Water
    1/4 c  Heavy cream
           Ganache:
      8 oz Bittersweet chocolate;
           -coarsely chopped
    3/4 c  Heavy cream
      1 tb Unsalted butter; softened
      2 tb Vanilla extract
           Confectioners' sugar
           Unsweetened cocoa powder
 
  In a small heavy saucepan, combine the sugar and water. Bring to a boil ove
  medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Then continue to boil,
  without stirring, 4 to 5 minutes longer, or until the syrup caramelizes and
  turns a deep amber in color.
   Immediately remove the syrup from the heat and add the cream. (The mixture
  will bubble up). Using a wooden spoon, stir until completely smooth; if
  necessary, briefly return the caramel to low heat and stir until smooth.
  Scrape into a small bowl and let cool to room temperature. Refrigerate unti
  well chilled, at least 2 hours.
   Make the ganache: Place the chocolate in a food processor fitted with the
  metal blade and process until finely chopped. In a small saucepan, over
  medium heat, bring Add the butter and vanilla and process for about 5
  seconds, or until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Scrape the ganache into
  a medium bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm enough to
  pipe, about 1 hour.
   Make the caramel centers: Line a small baking sheet with waxed paper.
  Using a 1/4-teaspoon measuring spoon dipped in cold water, scoop out level
  spoonfuls of the caramel and pl minutes.
   Form the truffles: Transfer the chilled ganache to a pastry bag fitted
  with a 1/2-inch plain t (such as Ateco #6). Pipe 1 1/4-inch mounds with
  pointed peaks onto a clean baking sheet. Refrigerate or freeze the truffles
  for 10 to 20 minutes, or until just firm enough to roll.
   Sift a light dusting of confectioners' sugar over the chilled truffles.
  Lightly coat the palms and fingertips of your hands with confectioners' sug
  between your palms into a slightly irregularly shaped 1 1/4 inch ball. Plac
  the rolled truffle on the baking sheet, and form the remaining truffles int
  rounds. Refrigerate the truffles for about 10 minutes, just until firm.
   Remove the rolled truffles from the refrigerator. Remove 5 or 6 of the
  caramel centers from the freezer and place on a cold plate. Working quickly
  with your fingertips, pinch a caramel center into a small ball.
   With the tip of your index finger, make an indentation about 2/3 of the wa
  through the center of a chocolate truffle. Insert the caramel center in the
  truffle and, with your fingertips, mold the chocolate over the caramel,
  covering it completely. Place on a baking sheet and repeat the procedure wi
  the remaining chocolate truffles and caramel centers. Refrigerate until fir
  at least 30 minutes.
   Roll half the chocolate truffles in sifted confectioners' sugar to coat.
  Roll the remaining truffles in sifted cocoa powder to coat. Store the truff

      8 oz Icing sugar
  3 1/2 t  Cocoa
      5 c  Rice Bubbles
    1/2 c  Sultanas (optional)
 
  Combine sifted icing sugar, cocoa, rice bubbles and optional sultanas. Melt
  copha and add to ingredients and mix thoroughly. Spoon into paper cups and
  allow to set.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A traditional Australian sweet snack -- Mention this recipe to an
  Australian abroad and he will instantly get homesick.  Yield:  serves 6.
  
  *  Rice Bubbles are called Rice Krispies in North America.  Icing sugar is
  confectioner's sugar.  Sultanas are like raisins.  Copha, it would appear,
  is utterly unavailable outside Australia. It is a partially-solidified
  shortening made of coconut oil.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy if you can get the ingredients.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooling.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

 Categories: Tips, Trellis, Dessert
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           -The Chefs touch:
 
  Hic flegetoteas patiatur sulphure flammas: "May he endure
  the fire and brimstone of hell." Contrary to this ancient
  curse, eating our chocolate damnation will bring about only
  heavenly pleasure. On the other hand, preparing it may drive
  
  you in the other direction.
  Although the preparation and assembly of this cake can be
  completed in one day (an early wake up call is recommended),
  it may be more practical to spread out the preparation over
  a two or three day period.
  
  Two-Day program: Day 1: Prepare and refrigerate the
  chocolate cheesecake, chocolate cake, and raspberry glaze
  (all covered with film wrap) until assembly. Keep the
  reserved cup of chocolate cookie crumbs at room temperature
  until assembly. Day 2: Early in the day, complete assembly
  except for the last ganache and cookie crumb coating, which
  can be done two to three hours before serving the cake. Cut
  and serve the cake as directed.
  
  Three-Day Program: Day 1: Prepare and refrigerate the
  chocolate cheesecake, chocolate cake and raspberry glaze
  (all covered with film wrap). Keep the reserved cup of
  chocolate cookie crumbs at room temperature until final
  assembly. Day 2: Complete assembly except for the ganache
  coating and cookie crumb coating. Keep the partially
  assembled cake refrigerated. Day 3: Early in the day,
  complete the final assembly. Keep the chocolate damnation
  refrigerated until cutting and serving.
  
  In making the cheesecake, it is important that the mixing
  bowl be frequently scraped down as directed and that the
  mixture be thoroughly combined. Failure to do so will result
  in a lumpy batter and visible white lumps or streaks of
  cream cheese in the baked cheese cake.
  Use several toothpicks inserted in the sides of the
  chocolate cake as guides to accurately halve the cake
  horizontally.
  The preparations may also be completed using a hand held
  electric mixer (mixing time may increase slightly), or by
  hand with a wire whisk (mixing time may double).
  Use half the following recipe to make the raspberry glaze if
  fresh red raspberries are not available.
  
  1 10oz package frozen red raspberries in syrup
  1/4 cup granulated sugar
  5 Tablespoons water
  1 Tablespoon fresh lemon juice
  
  Puree the frozen raspberries in a food processor fitted with
  a steel blade. Transfer the puree to a 2.1/2 qt saucepan and
  combine with sugar, water and lemon juice. Bring to a boil
  over medium high heat and allow to boil for 5 minutes.
  Remove and cool in an ice water bath. Refrigerate until
  ready to use.
  
  Ice Water Bath:
  
  In order to quickly lower temperature of foods, it is
  advisable to use an ice water bath.
  To reduce the development of food-spoiling bacteria, hot
  foods that are to be refrigerated must be cooled quickly
  before refrigeration. Depending on the volume of food to be
  cooled, the ice water bath may be set up in the kitchen
  sink, or in a stainless steel bowl large enough to hold the
  container of food to be cooled. There should be sufficient
  space in the sink or the bowl to place enough ice and water
  to surround most of the outside surface area of the
  container. Place a stainless steel ladle or stirring spoon
  in the container of food and stir frequently during the
  cooling process to promote rapid cooling.
  Certain items, such as ice cream and sorbert bases, need to
  be cooled before they are placed in an ice cream freezer to
  facilitate the freezing process.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
------------------------------------CAKE------------------------------------
      1 lb Tea biscuits
           -(dry cookies)
      3 T  Liqueur (chocolate
           -or coffee flavored)
      3 T  Brandy
  2 1/2 c  Cream
      3 c  Milk
      3 pk Chocolate pudding
           -(instant)
      1 pn Salt

----------------------------------FROSTING----------------------------------
      4 oz Chocolate, bittersweet
      4 oz Chocolate, milk
 
  Arrange a layer of biscuits at the bottom of a large baking pan.
  
  Mix the brandy and liqueur in a small container and pour on top of the
  biscuits.  Whip the cream, milk, pudding and salt until the mixture is
  thick. Pour the mixture on top of the biscuits. Chill well. When the cream
  is cold, prepare the frosting by grating the chocolate onto the top of the
  cake. Refrigerate before serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A no-bake chocolate cake -- This is a very simple, quick, no-bake cake
  for those of us who hate getting near an oven, but like delightful cheese
  cakes. This recipe is originally from the _Yediot Achronot_ (Latest News)
  newspaper supplement here in Israel. It should be prepared a day or two
  before you intend to eat it, so that the flavoring fills out. Definitely
  not for people on a diet. Yield: Serves 6-8.
  
  *  You can replace the milk and cream with about 1 1/2 lb of 9 percent milk
  fat cheese.  This is a product sold in Israel.  The nearest equivalent in
  North America is sour cream.  If you do this, replace the pudding with
  about 1/2 cup of chocolate syrup. If you are not a chocolate lover, you may
  replace the chocolate pudding with vanilla pudding (or with vanilla extract
  if you are using the 9 percent cheese)
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, several hours chilling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: Chocolate Fudge
 Categories: Candy
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      2 c  Sugar (granulated)
      1 c  Condensed milk
           -(unsweetened!)
      2 oz Chocolate, unsweetened
           -(I use Hershey's baking
           -chocolate; Baker's
           -chocolate does NOT work)
  2 1/2 t  Butter
    1/4 t  Salt
      1 T  Corn syrup (light)
      1 c  Walnuts (chopped)
      1 t  Vanilla extract
      1 T  Rum (I use Stroh's
           -Inlander rum)
 
  Combine sugar, condensed milk, butter, salt, chocolate and corn syrup in a
  HEAVY 3-quart saucepan.  Heat slowly.
  
  Stir until everything is melted.  When the chocolate is melted thoroughly,
  beat with electric mixer (I ain't proud!) until smooth.
  
  Let cook to halfway between soft and medium ball stage (use candy
  thermometer if available). Let cool until barely touchable (due to heat).
  Stir in chopped walnuts, vanilla and rum. Beat the mixture until it starts
  to set.
  
  When it starts to set, get it into an 8-inch square pan (buttered, of
  course). If you wait to do this, you will eat it out of the saucepan.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Rich fattening chocolate fudge -- This recipe makes fudge.  Not fudge
  brownies, just fudge.  I'm not sure what else to say about it. Yield: Makes
  1 8-inch pan.
  
  *  This is guaranteed to cause obesity if over-indulged in.
  
  : Difficulty:  Moderate to hard.  Melted chocolate is tricky, and the
  timing is fairly important.
  : Time:  about an hour.
  : Precision:  Measurement important for some ingredients.

      Yield: 1 servings
 
    2/3 c  Heavy cream
      1    Vanilla bean
      1 tb Mocha java; coarsely ground
           Few grains salt
      8 oz Bittersweet chocolate;
           -(good quality)
      2 ts Cognac
      1 oz Milk chocolate; (good qualit
           -y)
      2 ts Kahlua
    1/2 tb Unsalted butter
 
  Recipe by: Mary Malmros <malmros@id.wing.net> Split the vanilla bean
  lengthwise and add it to the cream, together with the salt and ground
  coffee.  Bring to a gentle boil, then continue boiing for one minute.
  Remove from heat and let sit a couple minutes, then strain through a fine
  sieve into a mixing bowl.
  
  Melt the chocolate (carefully).  I use a double boiler, which is dicey
  enough.  DO NOT use direct heat.
  
  Add the melted chocolate to the hot cream and whisk to blend.  Add the
  liqueurs and blend, then add the butter and blend.
  
  If this is to be used for truffles, you need to freeze it overnight.  For
  any other purpose, like a cake filling, I'd still refrigerate it a good bit
  to let it firm up.
  
  Here's one I use for truffles.  If you don't like coffee/mocha, omit the
  beans and substitute Cognac for the Kahlua.

  the untoasted almonds and continue to heat and stir until the
  mixture reaches a temperature of 225 degrees Fahrenheit.
  
  Evenly divide the honey-almond mixture between the two baking
  sheets. Place the baking sheets on the top and middle shelves of
  the preheated oven and bake until the mixture is evenly
  caramelized, about 24 to 26 minutes. Rotate the baking sheets
  from top to bottom about halfway through the baking time. Remove
  from the oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes.
  
  Combine the semisweet and unsweetened chocolate pieces and evenly
  divide and sprinkle over the surface of the caramelized honey-
  almond mixture. Allow to stand for 5 minutes. Use a spatula to
  spread the chocolate throughout the mixture. Evenly divide and
  sprinkle the toasted almonds over the chocolate. Place both
  baking sheets in the freezer for 20 minutes.
  
  Remove the Chocolate Honey Almond Crunch from the freezer and
  break into irregular pieces. Store in a sealed plastic container
  in the refrigerator or freezer.
  
  This candy is quite delicious eaten by itself or used in the
  following manner: chop the frozen crunch into 1/2 inch pieces and
  fold it into a semifrozen dark chocolate ice cream; freeze for
  several hours before serving. Now you have Double Chocolate Honey
  Almond Crunch Ice Cream!
  
  If the chocolate pieces do not completely melt on top of the
  honey-almond mixture, pop the baking sheets back into the oven
  for 10-15 seconds.
  
  Although it is suggested to freeze the Chocolate Honey Almond
  Crunch for 20 minutes before breaking it into irregular pieces,
  it is also possible to set this candy in the refrigerator for 45
  minutes or keep it at room temperature (68 to 72 degrees
  Fahrenheit) for 2 hours before breaking it into pieces.

      Title: Chocolate Intemperance
 Categories: Chocolate, Cake
      Yield: 8 to 10
 
----------------------------------FILLING:----------------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Semisweet chocolate
      3    Eggs; seperated
    1/2 c  Strong coffee
    1/2 c  Tia Maria
      2 T  Sugar
    1/2 c  Heavy cream

-----------------------------------CAKE:-----------------------------------
     23 oz Brownie mix
      2 T  Water
      3    Eggs

-----------------------------------GLAZE:-----------------------------------
    1/2 lb Semisweet chocolate
    1/3 c  Water
 
  Melt chocolate with coffee on top of a double boiler.  When chocolate is
  completely melted, remove pan from heat.  Beat egg yolks until pale yellow
  and stir into chocolate.  Gradually stir in Tia Maria. Cool mixture.
  
  In a seperate bowl, beat egg whites, gradually adding sugar until whites
  are stiff.  Whip cream.  Gently fold whipped cream into cooled chocolate
  mixture and then fold in egg whites.
  
  This mousse-filled, chocolate-swathed mold is an embarrassment of riches.
  When served to chocolate lovers, the only sound in the room will be faint
  moans of pure, unadulterated decadent pleasure.
  
  Preheat oven to 350.  Beat ingredients together at medium speed of
  electric mixer until batter is smooth.  Grease an 11-by-15 inch jellyroll
  pan.  Line it with waxed paper.  Grease and lightly flower paper, shaking
  off any excess flower.  Spread batter evenly in jellyroll pan.  Bake for
  10 to 12 minutes or until cake tests done.  Turn cake onto a rack and peel
  off paper. Lightly oil a 2-quart charlotte mold and line with cooled cake.
  Cut rounds of cake to fit both top and bottom of mold, and a strip for
  sides.  Place smaller round in bottom of mold.  (you will probably have to
  piece one section of side to cover completely,  but don't worry; any
  patchwork will be hidden by chocolate glaze.)  Fit larger round of cake on
  top of mold.  Chill for 3 or 4 hours or until firm.  Unmold and cover with
  glaze.
  
  Glaze:
  Melt chocolate in water and stir until smooth.  Spread over top of
  mousse-cake and drizzle down sides.  Chill again.  Serve in slender slices
  ~- its indecently opulent.
  
  Hints: Melt chocolate in microwave.  Its much faster.  Instructions are on
  the chocolate package.
  
  A souffle dish makes a good replacement for the Charlotte mold.

      Title: Chocolate Is Chocolate .. or Is It ?
 Categories: Reference
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 ea Robbie shelton xxxj77a
 
  Recipe by: Hershey's 'Chocolate Cookbook'
  Purists would limit the use of the word "chocolate" to just two forms;
  solid unsweetened chocolate or its liquid form, chocolate liquor. They're
  right, of course. But the rest of the world is happily willing to accept a
  much broader definition. Here's a little background on chocolate in its
  various phases and forms:
  
   ~CACAO (COCOA) BEANS: are the starting point. They are the fruit of the
  cocao tree, which is grown in a very limited climate zone - only 20
  degrees north and south of the Equator - and mainly in West Africa and
  Latin America.
  
   ~CACAO NIBS: are the "meat" for the beans. The beans are cleaned and then
  roasted at carefully controlled temperatures to bring out their full
  flavor and aroma.
  When the outer shells are removed, the nibs are ready to go on to greater
  things. (They contain more than 50% cocoa butter, and that's rich treasure
  indeed.)
  ~CHOCOLATE LIQUOR: is what makes all real chocolate products possible.
  The nibs are ground by a process that generates enough heat to liquefy the
  cocoa butter, thus creating the liquor. (The term "liquor" is used in its
  true sense, that of liquid essence - it has nothing to do with alcohol.)
  ~COCOA BUTTER:is the vegetable fat that's extracted when the chocolate
  liquor is "pressed" under high pressure. This butter has a distinctive
  melting quality that gives chocolate products their unique texture.
  
   ~COCOA POWDER: made by the American process (such as HERSHEY'S Cocoa) is
  the marvelous by-product that remains after most of the cocoa butter has
  been extracted from the liquor. It has no additives and no preservatives,
  so it's 100% pure. And because most of the cocoa butter has been removed,
  it has the lowest fat content of any chocolate product. Stored in a
  tightly closed container, cocoa will retain its freshness and quality
  almost indefinitely - and without refrigeration.
  
   ~DUTCH-PROCESS COCOA POWDER: is made from chocolate liquor that has been
  treated with an alkali agent.
  This makes a darker powder, with a flavor that differs from that of
  American-process cocoa.
  
   ~BITTER CHOCOLATE: commonly referred to as unsweetened, baking or cooking
  chocolate, is chocolate AU NATUREL. It is pure chocolate liquor, cooled
  and molded, usually in blocks.
  
   ~SEMI-SWEET CHOCOLATE:is a combination of chocolate liquor with added
  cocoa butter and sugar. To qualify for this term, the product must contain
  at least 35% chocolate liquor. Available in bars, this form is more
  popularly available in chips.
  
   ~SWEET (DARK) CHOCOLATE: combines the same ingredients as semi-sweet ,
  but the balance is different. This form must contain 15% chocolate liquor,
  but it has a higher sugar level.
  
   ~MILK CHOCOLATE: also uses the same ingredients but with the addition of
  milk or cream. At least 10% chocolate liquor is required in milk chocolate
  products.
  
   ~WHITE CHOCOLATE: also called confectioners' chocolate, is known in the
  chocolate industry as compound chocolate. It isn't really chocolate at
  all.
  Most or all of the cocoa butter has been removed and replaced by another
  vegetable fat, and it contains no chocolate liquor. Also called
  confectioners' coating, it is available in a range of colors, from dark to
  white and even pastels.
  
   ~CHOCOLATE-FLAVORED: is the term applied to food products that derive
  their flavor from cocoa and/or chocolate liquor but do not contain a
  sufficient quantity of these ingredients to meet the government's
  definition of "true" chocolate. Chocolate-flavored syrup, which combine
  chocolate liquor or cocoa, sugar, water, salt and sometimes other
  flavorings, are among the products in this category.
  
   ~ARTIFICIAL CHOCOLATE: is a product of the chemical industry, not
  chocolate-makers. Such products contain no ingredients derived from the
  cacao bean - and, at the extreme, contain no sugar or milk.
  
   This comes from "HERSHEY'S CHOCOLATE COOKBOOK".

      Title: Chocolate Marquise
 Categories: Mousse, Chocolate, Dessert
      Yield: 1 servings
 
     10 oz Semisweet or bittersweet
           -chocolate, cut in bits
      4 oz Sweet butter, cut into small
           -pieces
      2 t  Powdered (not freeze dried)
           -instant coffee
      2 t  Hot water
      4 lg Eggs, separated
    1/8 t  Cream of tartar
      2 T  Sugar
 
  Dissolve coffee in the hot water. Melt chocolate and butter
  together in a medium bowl placed in a pan of barely simmering
  water. Or, melt in a microwave on medium (50%) for about 2
  minutes and 30 seconds. Stir from time to time to hasten melting.
  When chocolate is melted and smooth, whisk in dissolved coffee
  powder and egg yolks. Remove from heat and set aside.
  
  In a clean, dry mixing bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar
  at medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually sprinkle in the
  sugar, beating at high speed until stiff but not dry. (My notes:
  Be careful not to overbeat. The texture won't be as silky if egg
  whites are too stiff.) Fold 1/4 of egg whites into chocolate
  mixture to lighten it. Fold remaining whites into mixture until
  completely incorporated. Scrape mousse immediately into prepared
  mold (see individual recipes). Refrigerate for at least 4 hours
  to set before unmolding. Marquise may be completed, covered, and
  refrigerated 2 days ahead of serving, or it may be frozen for up
  to 2 months.

           Garnish:
           Mint leaves
 
  Recipe by: Godiva's Home Page Preparation Time: 1:30 Make the ganache
  coating: Place a 8 1/2-by-4 1/2-by-2 3/4-inch non-stick metal loaf pan in
  the freez while preparing the ganache coating.
   Place the chocolate in a medium bowl. In a small saucepan, set over medium
  heat, bring the cream to a gentle boil. Pour the hot cream over the
  chocolate. Let the mixture stand for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate. Gent
  whisk until smooth. Stir in the creme de menthe.
   Remove the pan from the freezer. Pour half of the ganache into the pan.
  Quickly begin rotating the pan slowly, allowing the ganache to coat the
  inside of the pan evenly over the bottom and sides. Allow any excess ganach
  to drip back into the bowl. Return the pan to the freezer for 5 minutes.
   Remove the pan from the freezer and, using a small metal spatula, spread
  additional ganache over the sides of the pan only. Return the pan to the
  freezer. Cover the remaining ganache with plastic wrap and reserve at room
  temperature for glazing the terrine. Make the dark chocolate mousse: Melt
  the chocolate with the butter.  Set aside to cool.
   In a chilled, large bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer set at
  medium-high speed, whip the cream until soft mounds start to form.
  Refrigerate until needed.
   In a 4 1/2-quart bowl of an electric mixer, using the wire whip attachment
  beat the eggs, 1 tablespoon of the water, and salt at medium speed until
  blended. While continuing to beat, add the sugar in a steady stream. Remove
  the bowl from the mixer stand and place over a pot of hot water. (The botto
  of the bowl must touch the water.) Cook over medium-high heat, whisking
  constantly for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the granules of sugar have dissolve
  and the egg mixture has reached 140 degrees F on an instant-read thermomete
  Return the bowl to the mixer stand and beat at medium-high speed until the
  mixture is thick and pale yellow, about 8 minutes.
   Place the remaining 2 tablespoons of water in a small heatproof cup.
  Sprinkle the gelatin over the water and let it stand for 5 minutes to softe
  the gelatin.
   Place the cup with the softened gelatin in a saucepan with enough water to
  come halfway up the side of the cup. Heat the gelatin mixture over hot, not
  simmering, water. Stir the gelatin frequently for 3 to 4 minutes, or until
  the gelatin granules dissolve completely and the mixture is clear. Remove t
  pan from the heat. Leave the cup containing the gelatin mixture in the hot
  water to keep the gelatin warm until ready to use.
   Remove the egg mixture from the mixer stand and, using a large whisk,
  quickly whisk the gelatin in by hand. Using a large rubber spatula, gently
  fold one-third of the whipped cream into the egg mixture to lighten it. Fol
  in the remaining whipped cream.
   Remove the loaf pan from the freezer. Pour one-third of the chocolate mous
  into the pan and, using a small offset metal spatula, spread the mousse in
  even layer. Return the loaf pan to the freezer. Set the remaining chocolate
  mousse aside in a cool place, but do not refrigerate. Make the mint mousse:
  In a chilled, large bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer set at
  medium-high speed, whip the cream until soft mounds start to form.
  Refrigerate until needed.
   In a 4 1/2-quart bowl of an electric mixer, using the wire whip attachment
  beat the egg, yolk, and salt at medium speed until blended. While continuin
  to beat, add the sugar in a steady stream. Beat in the creme de menthe.
  Remove the bowl from the mixer stand and place over a pot of hot water. (Th
  bottom of the bowl must touch the water.) Cook over medium-high heat,
  whisking constantly for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the granules of sugar have
  dissolved and the yolk mixture has reached 140 degrees F on an instant-read
  thermometer. Return the bowl to the mixer stand and beat at medium-high spe
  until the mixture is thick and pale yellow, about 8 minutes.
   Place the 2 tablespoons water in a small cup. Sprinkle the gelatin over th
  water and let it stand for 5 minutes to soften the gelatin.
   Place the cup with the softened gelatin in a saucepan with enough water to

      Title: Chocolate Mosaic Fruit Tart
 Categories: Ghirardelli, Tarts, Chocolate, Dessert
      Yield: 8 servings
 
           -Chocolate Tart Crust:
 
  4 oz Ghirardelli Semi-Sweet Chocolate
  1/2 cup powdered sugar
  1/2 cup slivered almonds
  1/2 cup unsifted flour
  1/2 cup cold butter, cut up
  1/8 teaspoon salt
  1 egg
  1 teaspoon vanilla
  
  h Chocolate Tart Filling:
  
  1/2 cup butter, softened
  1/2 cup powdered sugar
  1 egg
  4 oz Ghirardelli Semi-Sweet Chocolate
  3 Tablespoons heavy whipping cream
  1 teaspoon vanilla or Grand Marnier
  Fresh fruit: strawberries, kiwi, bananas, green grapes, oranges, etc.
  1/4 cup apricot jam
  
  Crust:
  
  Place broken chocolate pieces, sugar and almonds into bowl of
  processor or blender. Process for about 20 to 25 seconds until
  the mixture is like powder. On top of chocolate mixture in food
  processor, spread flour, butter and salt. Process 15 to 20 pulses
  or until butter is in very fine pieces. (Or butter may be cut
  into flour by hand using a pastry cutter, then combined with
  chocolate.) Add egg and vanilla. Pulse about 15 times or stir
  lightly until mixture sticks together when pinched with fingers.
  On plastic wrap, knead a few times to bring dough together to
  form a ball; flatten to 8". It is easier to use your fingers to
  pat the dough into tart pan than to roll dough. Use a 10 1/2"
  flat tart pan with 1" fluted sides. Bake in center of oven at
  350-F for 15 to 18 minutes or until baked shell springs back when
  touched. (Do not overbake.) Cool. Remove outside ring of pan.
  Crust may be prepared a day in advance, if desired.
  
  Chocolate tart filling:
  
  In small mixer bowl, beat butter with sugar and egg; beat until
  fluffy. Melt broken chocolate in double boiler, stirring
  constantly, or microwave on medium for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Add
  warm chocolate to creamed mixture and beat well. Mix in cream and
  vanilla, beating until thick and creamy. Spread filling over
  baked Chocolate Tart Crust. While filling is still soft,
  artistically arrange fruit on top. For fruit glaze, strain
  apricot jam. With pastry brush, use glaze to cover pieces of
  fruit and top edge of crust. Chill about 2 hours. Decorate with
  chocolate curls, if desired. Let stand 30 minutes at room
  temperature before serving.

      Title: Chocolate Mousse
 Categories: Mousse
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
-----------------------------------CRUST-----------------------------------
    1/2 c  Butter
      1 c  Flour
      1    Egg yolk (see note)
      1 t  Vanilla
      1 t  Lemon peel, grated
           -(optional)

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
     13 oz Chocolate, semisweet
           -(see note)
      3 oz Unsweetened chocolate
      2    Eggs, whole
      4    Eggs, separated
     16 oz Whipping cream
           Powdered sugar
           -(confectioner's)
 
  Make the crust:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Cut flour and butter
  together.  With a fork mix in egg yolk, vanilla and lemon peel. Press onto
  the bottom and sides of a 9 inch springform pan, and bake for 10-12 minutes
  at 350 degrees F., or until it just begins to turn slightly golden.
  
  Melt all the chocolate in a double boiler.    Whip the whipping cream with
  about 2-3 T of powdered sugar (the stiffer you whip it, the stiffer the
  mousse will be).
  
  Beat the eggs whites with about 2-3 T powdered sugar.
  
  Remove the top pan of the double boiler (with the  melted chocolate) from
  the bottom pan and let it cool a bit. ("Cool" means it's only cool enough
  so that when you add the eggs in the next step, they don't cook. You still
  need to be able to stir it.)
  
  Add the whole eggs to the chocolate, one at a time, and mix well. Then add
  the egg yolks one at a time and mix well.
  
  Mix some of the whipping cream (enough to lighten the chocolate) into the
  chocolate.  Alternately fold in the whipping cream and the egg whites into
  the chocolate. Pour into the crust. Refrigerate 6 hours or overnight.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A rich but not cloying chocolate mousse -- This recipe is based on one
  that appeared several years ago in _Bon Appetit_. After much
  experimentation, we have come up with this recipe, which is less sweet than
  the original and downright scrumptious. (I even like it, and I don't
  generally like chocolate anything.) Yield: Serves 12-20.
  
  *  This is my cheesecake crust.  A graham cracker crust works well too. The
  original recipe used a crust made from chocolate wafer cookies.
  
  *  If you have no better use for the extra egg white in making the crust,
  add it to the egg whites used in the filling.
  
  *  I don't recommend Ghirardelli chocolate, as it's too sweet.
  
  *  The function of the powdered sugar is to help the cream/whites stiffen.
  The sweetness of the mousse comes from the semisweet chocolate, not the
  powdered sugar.  You can also use a 12-inch springform. Instead of putting
  the crust up the entire sides, just go up half way. Or you can use two
  8-inch springforms. In this case either spread the crust very thin or
  increase the crust by 50 percent.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate to hard.
  : Time:  About 45-60 minutes for beginners, 30 minutes once you have it
  down. Cooking time: 15 minutes for the crust.
  : Precision:  crust ingredients should be measured precisely.

  Recipe by: Jessica Chaiken <11JCHAIKEN@GALLUA.GALLAUDET.EDU> Put the

  the blender with a knife.  Add the water and blend on high for 10 seconds.
  Then add the yolks and liquer/coffee and blend until smooth.
  
  Meanwhile, beat the egg ehites to stiffness.
  
  Fold the chocolate into the egg whites.  Pour mousse into cups or into the
  graham crakcer crust.  It makes about 4-6 servings.
  
  Break the crackers into a blender and blend into crumbs.  Place the crumbs
  into a bowl.  Stir in the sugar, cinnamon and add the butter and mix.  Pres

           -ground
      1 oz Unsweetened chocolate;
           -finely ground
      4 oz Heavy whipping cream
      6 tb Unsalted butter
      2    Eggs; separated
           Bailey's irish cream;
           -optional
 
  Recipe by: Tracy McCulloch Add butter to crumbs just until it will hold its
  shape when pressed into a pan. I'm sorry but I've never bothered to measure
  the butter!
  
  MOUSSE:
  
  Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks forms.  Set aside. Heat the cream and
  medium heat.  When the butter is well-incorporated into the cream, add the
  chocolates.Stir off the heat until melted and well-blended. Add the egg
  yolks.
  
  Quickly fold 1/4 of the chocolate mixture into the beaten whites, then fold
  the whites into the chocolate.
  
  Fill the crust with the filling and refrigerate several hours.  If you like
  may add Bailey's Irish Cream to the filling to flavour and whip cream with
  a tiny bit of sugar and some Frangelico liqueur.  Amaretto for the whipping
  cream is also nice.  It's just a decadent final touch to an alread-decadent
  dessert.

      Title: Chocolate Nut Cake
 Categories: No-bake, Cake
      Yield: 1 Cake
 
    1/4 lb Butter (or margarine)
      1 c  Icing sugar
      2 lg Eggs
    3/4 c  Cashews or almonds
  2 1/2 t  Cocoa
    1/2 lb Graham crackers
           Milk
    3/4 t  Vanilla
 
  Cream together the butter and sugar.  Chop the nuts and roast if desired.
  
  Soak the crackers in the milk until they are soft but have not turned to
  mush. Dissolve cocoa in about 2 T milk, and add this and the nuts to the
  creamed butter/sugar mixture.
  
  Separate the eggs and set the whites aside.  To the creamed mixture add the
  yolks and  vanilla and beat.  Whip the whites until stiff peaks form, then
  fold this into the mixture.
  
  Line a 9-inch square pan with a layer of crackers, mixture, and crackers.
  Top with the remaining mixture and set in the refrigerator until hard.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A no-bake graham-cracker chocolate cake -- This is a delicious,
  easy-to-make cake that everyone enjoys.  It came from an East Indian friend
  of mine who said it had been in the family. It seems western so I am
  uncertain of its origins.
  
  *  Depending on how you want the texture of the cake you can soak the
  crackers until they are slightly softened or until they fall apart.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, several hours chilling.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

  Melt chocolate and butter in double boiler, stirring until smooth.  In
  another double boiler, heat the eggs, stirring constantly to prevent
  curdling, until just warm to the touch.  Remove from the heat and beat
  until triple in volume and soft peaks form when the beater is raised, about
  5 minutes.  Using a wire whisk or rubber spatula, fold 1/2 the eggs into
  the chocolate until almost incorporated.  Fold in the remaining eggs until
  just blended and no streaks remain.  Scrape into prepared pan.  Set the pan
  in the larger pan and surround it with 1 inch of very hot water. Bake 5
  minutes.  Cover loosely with a piece of buttered foil and bake 10 minutes.
  The cake will look soft, but this is as it should be.  Let the cake cool on
  a rack 45 minutes.  Cover and refrigerate until very firm, about 3 hours.

      Yield: 3 Dozen
 
    3/4 c  Margarine
    3/4 c  Cocoa
      2 c  Flour
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      4    Eggs
      2 t  Vanilla
    1/2 t  Salt

  Melt the margarine and mix with the cocoa.
  
  In a small bowl, mix flour and salt.
  
  In a large mixing bowl, beat eggs.  Then add sugar, vanilla, and beat well.
  Add flour and margarine mixture to this and blend thoroughly.
  
  Heat skillet to medium-low.  Drop small clumps (about 1 T) and cook like
  pancakes:  about 1 1/2 minutes on one side, 1/2 minute on the other, then
  turn over again and remove after a few seconds. Freeze. When relatively
  hard, coat one side with buttercream frosting.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Brownies in a skillet -- This recipe is based on a "chocolate turtle"
  recipe by Mae Rabenius from a cookbook produced by Faith United Methodist
  Church in Phoenix, Arizona.  Yield:  40 pieces.
  
  *  One side of the pancakes may burn.  It doesn't particularly affect the
  taste, and if you frost this side, no one will even know.
  
  *  It's not necessary to cook the pancakes completely; if the middle looks
  somewhat gooey, don't fret:  it will soon harden.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 30 minutes to cook, 10 minutes to frost.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

           -chopped
    3/4 c  Heavy cream
      2 tb Corn syrup
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  Recipe by: webmaster@godiva.com Preparation Time: 3:00 Make the rain forest
  praline:
  
   1. Line a baking sheet with foil and butter lightly. Set aside. In a
  small, heavy saucepan, combine the sugar and 1/4 cup of water.
   Cook the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon
  until the sugar is dissolved. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring
  the sugar syrup to a boil without stirring; cook the syrup until it
  caramelizes and turns an amber color.
   Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the toasted nuts, stirring for
  about 1 minute. Pour the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet and allow
  it to cool completely.
  
  Make the rain forest cocoa meringue round:
  
   1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 F.
   Line a baking sheet with foil. Lightly butter the foil, dust with flour,
  and tap off the excess. Using a small knife, trace one 9-inch circle on the
  baking sheet.
  
   2. In a food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade, combine the
  toasted Brazil nuts, cashews and 4 tablespoons of the sugar.
   Process for 30 to 40 seconds, until finely ground. Add the flour and cocoa
  powder and pulse on and off 4 or 5 times, until well blended.
  
   3. In a grease-free, 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duly electric mixer,
  using the whip attachment. whip the whites until stiff peaks form.
  Gradually add the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar and whip until the
  whites are shiny and stiff but not dry.
  
   4. Sprinkle the nut cocoa mixture over the beaten whites, and using a
  rubber spatula, quickly fold the mixtures until just blended.
  
   5. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a medium plain tip (such as Ateco #5)
  with the mixture. Pipe a spiral pattern of the meringue, about 1/2-inch
  thick, into the outlined circle on the baking sheet. If there are any
  holes, pipe meringue into the spaces, then using a small offset metal
  spatula spread the meringue evenly.
  
   6. Bake the rounds for about 25 minutes, until the edges begin to brown.
  Remove the baking sheet to a rack and let cool completely.
   Carefully, peel the aluminum foil off the bottom of the meringue.
  
  Make the chocolate curls:
  
   1. Temper the chocolate according to the directions for tempering.
   Spread the tempered chocolate onto a clean, dry counter or work surface.
  Before the chocolate hardens, make the curls by holding a metal dough
  scraper or 4-inch metal spatula at a 45 degree angle and pushing away from
  you. The chocolate will curl upon itself.
   Using a bamboo skewer gently lift the curls onto a foil-lined baking sheet
  and set aside until ready to assemble the torte.
  
  Make the caramel rum syrup:
  
   1. In a small, heavy saucepan, combine the sugar and 1/4 cup of water.
  Cook the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon
  until the sugar is dissolved. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring
  the sugar syrup to a boil without stirring; cook the syrup until it
  caramelizes and turns an amber color.

  you'll ever taste. The recipe has been passed down in our family for years
  and years.
  
  *  This sauce becomes like fudge candy when refrigerated, and it's hard to
  keep from poking your finger in it for a taste.  Simply reheat in a
  saucepan to melt it down.

           -pitted and halved

------------------------------SHORTCAKE DOUGH------------------------------
  2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour; unsifted
    1/4 c  Cocoa powder
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 T  Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 lg Egg
    3/4 c  Cold buttermilk
    1/2 c  Milk; cold +
      2 T  Milk; cold
      2 ts Orange zest; finely grated
      6 oz Unsalted butter (3/4 cup)
           -cut into 1/4-inch slices
      3 T  Sugar; for topping

----------------------------------TOPPING----------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Cold whipping cream
      1 T  Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla
    1/4 c  Powdered sugar; optional
 
  Place the strawberries in a large bowl, add the sugar
  and gently toss. Set aside at room temperature for at
  least 2 hours.  Using a fork, mash one-third of the
  strawberries; toss again, then add raspberries and
  cherries.  Let stand 1 hour.  Adjust rack to lower
  third of oven; preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Line a
  large baking sheet with parchment paper.
  
  DOUGH:  Sift the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking
  powder, baking soda and salt into a large bowl.
  
  Combine the egg, buttermilk, milk and orange zest in a
  small bowl; stir to mix.  Cut the butter into the dry
  ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse meal.
  Add the egg mixture and stir just until it forms a
  soft and moist, sticky dough.
  
  Spoon 1/4-cup mounds of dough about 2 inches apart on
  the baking sheet. Sprinkle a small amount of sugar
  over each mound and gently pat dough to 1/2- to
  3/4-inch thickness.  (After patting, shortcakes should
  be about 1 inch apart.)  Bake about 20 minutes, or
  until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out
  clean. Remove shortcakes to a wire rack to cool. (You
  may freeze the shortcakes in a sturdy container for up
  to 2 weeks.)
  
  TOPPING:  Whip cream with the sugar and vanilla until
  soft peaks form.
  
  ASSEMBLY:  Split the shortcakes in half horizontally,
  preferably with the tines of a fork. Place the bottom
  halves on dessert plates. Top each with berries and
  cherries, then with whipped cream. Set the top of
  shortcakes on the whipped cream.  If desired, sprinkle
  with a light dusting of powdered sugar. Serves 12.

      Title: Chocolate Truffles
 Categories: Candy
      Yield: 2 Dozen
 
      1 c  Sugar
    3/4 c  Chocolate, powdered
    1/2 c  Whipping cream
    1/4 c  Butter, unsalted
 
  Put all ingredients in a solid sauce-pan, mix while bringing slowly to the
  boil.  Boil gently.  After two minutes you will have a wonderful icing for
  cakes, and a sauce for ice cream.
  
  After six minutes (or a little longer if you want your truffles harder)
  take sauce-pan off heat and allow the mixture to cool slightly. At this
  point you can add dark rum or any other liqueur if you wish. Cool in the
  refrigerator for about one hour.
  
  Form into balls about the size of large marbles and roll them in powdered
  chocolate.  Cool to room temperature, or chill.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Very simple chocolate truffles -- I found this recipe in the flight
  magazine for a trip from London to Vienna.  I think Vienna is probably the
  best place in the world for cakes and sweets.  Whatever you do, never go to
  Vienna if you are on a diet.  This is also the only recipe I have ever
  collected that is in cups rather than grams! Yield: Makes 25-30.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooling, 1 hour forming balls.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: Chocolate Truffles (French-Style)
 Categories: Candy
      Yield: 5 Pounds
 
      3 lb Chocolate (semi-sweet
           -or semi-bittersweet)
      1 qt Cream, very heavy
    1/2 lb Butter, sweet (i.e.
           -unsalted butter)
           Cocoa powder
 
  Melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler.  Do not cook the
  chocolate. This should be done SLOWLY over minimum heat.
  
  Boil the cream.  Once the chocolate is completely melted and the cream just
  boiled, combine in the top of the double boiler.  Take off the top pan from
  the water, and (off heat) mix until completely combined. Keep stirring
  until it is relatively cool. Allow to sit until it is cool enough to put
  into a refrigerator.
  
  Refrigerate overnight (NO SHORT CUTS HERE!!!).
  
  The next morning, melt this wonderful mixture again in a double boiler.
  When it is completely melted again, mix in the butter until it is
  completely absorbed. Whip, either with a hand whisk or a very slow electric
  gizmo, until the butter is completely absorbed and the mixture is cool
  again.  This can take an hour or longer, depending upon the chocolate, etc.
  Let cool and refrigerate overnight once more (this is not as critical as
  the first cooling; a few hours will be enough).
  
  Heat once again and whip until cool.   Refrigerate until it is thick enough
  to pipe through a pastry bag. Using a 1/2 nozzle, make little balls on a
  big piece of parchment paper that has cocoa powder spread on it. Roll in
  the powder. Keep chilled until just before serving. Let them return to just
  above room temperature before eating.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  French-style chocolate confectionery -- For those of you who are crazy
  enough about chocolate to go to the extremes that I do, here is the recipe
  for the chocolate truffles that I make. The formula is taken from Paul
  Bocuse's "French Cooking," but the directions are my own.
  
  *  If you like Grand Marnier or Kahlua or rum or whatever in your
  chocolate, the last melting step is the time to add. I think it's a small
  but forgivable sin myself.
  
  *  I recommend Guittard chocolate.  You can buy their semisweet chips in 12
  ounce bags.  You can also buy it in 10 pound bars.  You can also buy
  10-pound bars of Guittards "French Vanilla Semi bittersweet" which is so
  good you might eat all of it before you cook with it. Guittard makes 5
  types of bittersweet if you like you chocolate really bitter. I use
  Hershey's Cocoa.  Still the best for my taste.
  
  *  Use genuine, real-live, honest "heavy cream" and not ultra-pasteurized
  whipping cream.  Try a wholesale dairy.  I only use Challenge Sweet Butter.
  Under no circumstances should you use anything but unsalted butter in this
  recipe.
  
  : Difficulty:  quite difficult (melting the chocolate 3 times requires
  tremendous care).
  : Time:  3 or 4 hours of preparation during a 3-day period.
  : : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: Chocolate Truffles Ii
 Categories: Candy
      Yield: 10 Dozen
 
      2 lb Dark, coating chocolate
      6 oz Chocolate, unsweetened,
           -baking (or more, to taste)
      3 oz Butter, unsalted
  1 1/4 c  Cointreau
 
  Chop the chocolate.  Melt together with the butter over simmering water.
  Stir continuously with a rubber spatula. Don't let water get into the
  chocolate.
  
  Warm the Cointreau to the same temperature as the chocolate.  Slowly blend
  the Cointreau into the chocolate (still over the water). Stir continuously.
  Do this slowly (as if you were making Hollandaise). Using an electric
  mixer, beat the mixture until cool and somewhat thickened. (Takes about 5
  minutes; you'll need a good mixer.)
  
  Line a large baking sheet (11 x 17) with wax paper.  Pour in the truffle
  mix. (This will fill the pan.) Chill in the refrigerator until solid
  (several hours).
  
  Use a pizza cutter to cut the stuff into strips (peel off the wax paper
  first), then into squares.  Take each one, mash it in your palm, and roll
  in cocoa. Chill some more.
  
  I recommend Merckens Yucatan or Lindt Extra Bittersweet for the dark
  coating chocolate. In place of the Cointreau, try substituting other
  liqueurs (Chambord, Amaretto, Kahlua) and coatings (chopped roasted
  almonds, finely chopped candied orange peel, coffee beans run through a
  nutmeg grinder, etc.)
  
  Truffles rolled in cocoa are "classic", here are some rough and ready
  instructions for coating anything with chocolate, abstracted from "Making
  Chocolates" by Alec Leaver, published in 1975 by Weathervane Books by
  arrangement with Michael Joseph Ltd.  (The book is out of print.)
  
  Melt some chocolate over hot water, let it cool slowly until it just
  thickens (80-84 F). Now warm the chocolate gently and slowly until it thins
  slightly. The temperature should be above 85, but below 91. This maximum
  working temperature is absolutely crucial. The temperature of the room you
  work in should not exceed 70.
  
  Pre-bottom all centers, that is, smear a little couverature on what will be
  the bottom of the center with the back of a spoon and place it, bottom side
  up, on a plate.  This lets you check that the couverature is properly
  tempered.
  
  After the bases have set and hardened a little, stir the couverature
  thoroughly, trying not to get too many air-bubbles in.  Drop a center into
  the couverature, bottom down and, with an ordinary fork, slightly warmed,
  push it down to submerge it fully. Immediately, pick it out with the fork,
  tap the fork on the side of the bowl in order to settle the chocolate, and
  wipe any excess from underneath the fork. Transfer the center to a sheet of
  wax paper. Stir the couverature after depositing each center to keep it
  well mixed.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Classic chocolate confectionery -- These are as good, or better, than
  anything you can buy in a store.
  
  *  The basis of the truffle centre is ganache paste, a mixture of melted
  chocolate and warm cream well blended and cooled until it hardens. Orange,
  honey, peppermint, rum or vanilla can be added to give flavor, but it is
  important that the final mixture should be hard enough to be moulded to
  shape and be capable of standing up to being coated with chocolate.
  
  *  The texture of ganache paste depends upon the kinds of cream and
  chocolate and the proportions in which they are used. Plain chocolate is
  harder than milk chocolate, so more cream can be added to it. Single cream
  is thinner than double so must be used in smaller quantities. Incorporating
  cream or other liquids fulfills two functions: it softens the chocolate and
  it gives flavor. After the centre has been made and moulded to shape, it is
  coated with chocolate to seal it and help to keep it moist. It is then
  rolled in a final decorative coating, and this can cocoa sweetened with a
  little icing sugar, or chopped mixed nuts.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate for classic truffles, quite difficult for coated
  centers.
  : Time:  most of a day.
  : Precision:  measure carefully.

      Title: Chocolate-Chip Cookies
 Categories: Cookie
      Yield: 1 Dozen
 
      1 c  Flour (plus 2 T)
    1/2 t  Salt
    1/2 t  Baking soda
    1/2 c  Butter, softened
           -(1 stick)
      6 T  Sugar, white
      6 T  Brown sugar
    1/2 t  Vanilla extract
      1 lg Egg
      6 oz Nestle's chocolate
           -chips (1 package)
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Sift flour, salt, baking soda together in a
  small bowl.
  
  In another bowl, mix butter with two sugars, vanilla and egg until smooth.
  gradually mix dry stuff in with butter mixture.  Mix in chocolate chips.
  Put blobs of dough on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake at 375 degrees F. for
  8-10 minutes.
  
  Important: double all proportions above (always make 2 x  as much of these
  as the recipe calls for). Let's face it: small is beautiful, but big
  cookies are better than small ones. All the printed recipes call for teeny
  cookies, dropped by teaspoonsful onto cookie sheets (yield 50). My "blobs
  of dough" are golf-ball sized, which makes healthy 3-4 inch cookies.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Cookies like what Mom should have made -- There is no substitute for
  chocolate-chip cookies, warm out of the oven, washed down with cold milk.
  This is Mom's recipe, and Mom's Mom's recipe.  This is also Nestle's "Toll
  House" recipe, and the Joy of Cooking "Chocolate-Chip Drop Cookies" recipe,
  etc, which is no coincidence. This is the default recipe. This is not Mrs.
  Field's recipe. If you want Mrs. Field's, use a shopping mall; if you want
  simple, elegant, timeless chocolate-chip cookies, use this recipe. Yield:
  12 big cookies.
  
  *  I invariably make these on the spur of the moment, and so usually nuke
  the butter in a microwave to soften it up. I also occasionally cheat and
  soften up the butter/sugar mixture a tad in the oven.
  
  *  Try adding walnuts, macadamia, white chocolate, orange peel,
  butterscotch chips, or mint, all these are welcome variations. But keep it
  simple.

  each ball. When all cookies are molded, prepare
  frosting and use immediately. Makes 4 dozen
  
  FROSTING
  
  1 cup semisweet chocolate (8 squares)
  1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk
  1/4 tsp. salt
  1 1/2 tsp. cherry juice
  
  Melt chocolate with milk, stirring constantly.  Remove

  smooth.  Spread 1/2 teaspoon frosting over each
  cherry.  Bake at 350 deg. for 8 to 10 minutes.

  Recipe by: webmaster@godiva.com Make the caramel nut ice cream:
  
   1. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks, 1 tablespoon of the sugar and
  the salt until blended.
  
   2. In a medium saucepan, bring the half-and-half and cream to a gentle
  boil. Remove the pan from the heat.
  
   3. In a heavy, large saucepan, using a wooden spoon, stir together the
  remaining sugar and lemon juice. Over medium heat, cook the sugar mixture
  for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until it liquefies and then turns
  to an amber-colored caramel. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the
  half-and-half mixture. Return the pan to the heat and cook, stirring
  constantly, to help dissolve any caramel that may have hardened. Bring the
  caramel mixture to a gentle boil and remove the pan from the heat.
  
   4. Gradually whisk about 1 cup of the hot caramel mixture into the beaten
  egg yolks until blended. Return this mixture to the saucepan. Continue
  cooking over medium low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon for 2
  to 4 minutes, or until the custard has thickened slightly. It is done when
  you can run your finger down the back of the custard-coated spoon and a
  path remains. Do not let the custard boil.
  
   5. Remove the pan from the heat and immediately strain the custard through
  a sieve into a stainless steel bowl. Place the bowl over a larger bowl of
  ice water and stir the custard for 5 to 10 minutes, or until cool. Stir in
  the vanilla. Remove the bowl of custard from the bowl of ice water. Cover
  the surface of the custard with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6
  hours, or overnight, until very cold.
  
   6. Scrape the chilled custard into the container of an ice cream maker and
  freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions, adding the chopped
  almonds for the last 2 minutes of freezing.
   Transfer the ice cream to a bowl. Cover the surface of the ice

  1 1/4 c  Graham cracker crumbs
      1 c  Coconut, shredded
  1 1/4 c  Chocolate chips
  1 3/4 c  Condensed milk,
           -sweetened (1 can)
 
  Melt the margarine in a 9x13-inch pan.  Combine with graham cracker crumbs
  and spread evenly on bottom of pan. Sprinkle coconut evenly over crumbs.
  Sprinkle chocolate chips evenly over coconut.  Pour condensed milk evenly
  over everything. Bake for 30 minutes at 350 degrees F.
  
  Let cool for a bit.  Cut into squares and enjoy.  Mom insists on using
  "Borden Eagle Brand" sweetened condensed milk. Don't ask me why.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A nicely fattening combination of coconut and chocolate chips -- This
  comes from Mom. (She doesn't know where she got it; she memorized it years
  ago and lost the original recipe.) It's always been a favorite with us
  kids, and last time I was home she gave me the recipe. It's so simple that
  even a complete clutz like myself was able to make it perfectly the first
  time.

    1/3 c  Blanched whole almonds
    1/4 c  Unsweetened alkalized;

  3 1/2 tb Unsweetened alkalized;
           -cocoa, sifted
    3/4 ts Vanilla extract
           Cocoa; for garnish
 
  SPECIAL EQUIPMENT: Six 4 1/2-inch fluted tartlette pans with removable
  bottoms.
   Make the cocoa almond crust: Position a rack in the center of the oven and
  preheat to 350 degrees F. In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the
  metal chopping blade, place the flour, sugar, almonds, cocoa powder and
  salt. Process the dry ingredien for 30 to 45 seconds, until the almonds are
  coarsely chopped. Add the butte pieces and the vanilla to the bowl and
  pulse the mixture 5 or 6 times until incorporated but still crumbly. Add
  the ice water and pulse a few more time to form a dough.
   Divide the dough mixture (it will still be crumbly) among six 4 1/2 inch
  tartlette pans with removable bottoms. Using your fingertips, press the dou
  into the bottom and up the sides of each pan. Place the tartlette pans on a
  baking sheet; place the sheet in the freezer for 45 minutes.
   Remove the tartlette shells from the freezer. Cover the pans with a sheet
  aluminum foil, pressing the foil against the bottom and sides of each pan.
  Fill each pan, over the foil, with ceramic pie weights or dried beans. Bake
  the tartlette shells for 15 minutes. Remove the foil and weights. Return th
  shells to the oven and hake an additional 10 minutes. Cool the tartlette
  shells on a wire rack completely.
   Make the milk chocolate almond filling: Break the Toblerone bars up into
  pieces, following the bars' indentations, chopping blade. Add the cocoa to
  the bowl and process the chocolate for 30 45 seconds, until finely ground.
  Transfer the chocolate to a medium bowl.
  
   In a small saucepan, bring the cream to a gentle boil. Pour the hot cream
  over the chocolate. Let the mixture stand for 30 seconds to melt the
  chocolate. Gently whisk until smooth. Stir in the almond extract. Remove 1
  Fill the cocoa clouds: Using a hand-held electric mixer set at medium
  speed, heat the reserved 1 1 cups filling for 1 to 2 minutes until light in
  color and fluffy. Scrape the unwhipped filling onto the tartlette shells,
  dividing it evenly. Use a smal metal cake spatula to smooth the filling
  into an even layer in the bottom o each shell. Scrape the whipped mixture
  over this filling, dividing it evenl and smoothing it into an even layer on
  each shell.
   Make the cocoa cream: In a chilled, medium bowl, stir together the cream,
  sugar, cocoa and vanill (the mixture will not be cohesive). Using a
  hand-held electric mixer set at medium-high speed, beat the mixture until
  stiff peaks just start to form. Cover and refrigerate the cocoa cream until
  up to two hours before serving Garnish the cocoa clouds: Remove the
  tartlettes from the pans. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip
  (such as Ateco #5) with the cocoa cream. Pipe the cream in a shell pattern
  over the filling on each tartlette, covering it completely. Place e
  refrigerate for up to 2 hours before serving.

  That Hershey Cocoa fudge recipie is absolutely smashing as a fudge
  sauce on ice cream.  Just don't cook it as long.  I add 1/4 cup of

  Nina - get the Hershey Chocolate powder and look on the can for the fudge
  candy recipe.  Make it as directed but:
  
   Add 1/4 cup flour to the sugar and mix in well.
   Replace all or part of the milk with wine or add a bit of ascorbic acid.
   Only cook it to just past the first rolling boil - long enough to cook
  the
  flour.
  
  This makes a marvelous fudge topping for ice cream and an absolutely
  scrumptious filling for a chocolate cake.

      Title: Coconut Joys
 Categories: Holiday, Cookie
      Yield: 3 Dozen
 
    1/4 lb Butter (or margarine)
      3 c  Coconut
           -(one standard package)
      2 c  Powdered sugar
      2 oz Chocolate (unsweetened),
           -melted (2 squares)
 
  Melt butter in a sauce pan.  Remove from heat.  Add powdered sugar and
  coconut.  Mix well.
  
  Shape rounded teaspoons of mixture into balls.  Make an indent in center of
  each and place on cookie sheet.  Fill centers with melted chocolate. Chill
  until firm.  Store in refrigerator.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Super-sweet, super-rich holiday cookies -- This is an easy recipe that
  can knock your socks off for flavor and sweetness. In other words, it will
  make your teeth fall out.
  
  *  We use sweetened coconut and also use semi-sweet chocolate.  This is why
  they make your teeth fall out.
  
  *  I tried an approach of melting the stick of margarine using the
  microwave on full for 48 seconds. While it was melting, I measured and
  mixed up the dry ingredients. I then poured half the liquid over the
  premixed coconut-sugar mixture; mixed some and poured in the remainder.
  This worked well for me, but my wife insists that the listed method is
  easier.
  
  *  Your clean thumb is the best way to make the indentations.
  
  *  Be sure to keep them in the refrigerator until ready to serve.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour chilling.

      Title: Cognac Cookies
 Categories: To be edit
      Yield: 3 Dozen
 
      6 oz Chocolate chips
           -(semi-sweet)
  2 1/2 c  Vanilla wafers,
           -crushed fine (a box
           -less some nibbles)
      1 c  Pecans (finely chopped;
           -start with 8-10 oz
           -whole pecans)
    1/2 c  Sugar (white,
           -granulated)
    1/4 c  Corn syrup
    1/3 c  Cognac (Use the best
           -you can afford,
           -it makes a difference!)
 
  Melt chocolate bits.  If you have never worked with melted chocolate
  before, then use a double boiler with the burner set on low.
  
  Crush vanilla wafers very fine (fineness is important).  Chop pecans (again
  fineness is everything).  Add sugar, corn syrup and cognac (I use 1 nip of
  cognac and  1/2 nip of rum, works fine and costs less). Stir in pecans and
  wafer crumbs.  Now you learn why you were supposed to grind them very
  finely.
  
  By now the mixture should be a smooth paste.  Remove from heat and form
  into about 1-inch balls. Roll balls in extra granulated sugar.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A rich chocolate no-bake cookie -- A terrific, very rich, no-bake
  cookie. Adapted from a recipe in the "Silver Palate Good Times Cookbook."
  Yield: makes 3-4 dozen.
  
  *  Store these in an air-tight container; if you are a chocoholic, have
  someone hide them from you.  They are best if you allow  them to age and
  mellow.
  
  : Difficulty:  Moderate to hard (melted chocolate is tricky, and rolling
  the mixture into balls takes practice).
  : Time:  30-60 minutes or more, depending on how deftly you can roll the
  balls.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: Death By Chocolate #4
 Categories: Chocolate, Dessert
      Yield: 1 pie
 
-------------------------           ==---CRUST------------------------------
    1/2 c  Chocolate Wafer crumbs
      6 T  Sweet Butter

------------------------           ==---FILLING----------------------------
     12 oz Semi-sweet Chocolate
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
      8 oz Sweet butter; softened
      2 T  Kahlua
      1 pn Salt

-------------------------           ==---SAUCE------------------------------
    1/2 c  Whipping cream
      4 T  Sugar
    1/4 c  (1/2 stick) butter
      1 ts Finely grnd Expresso coffee

------------------------           ---KAHLUA WHIPPE------------------------
    1/2 pt Whipping cream
      1 T  Kahlua (to 3T)
      1 T  Powdered sugar (to 3T)
 
  Crust Instructions:
  Crush or grind fine chocolate wafers in food processor or put wafer in a
  ziploc and crush with a rolling pin.  Melt butter and blend into crumbs.
  Pat into tart or 9" pie pan.  Chill until firm (about 1 hour) before
  filling or bake at 300 degrees for 15 minutes, cool,and fill.
  
  If chilled, just before serving, rub the outside of the filled pie plate
  with a warm, damp towel.  This softens the butter in the crust, making it
  less likely to stick to the pie plate.  To prepare the towel, rinse it in
  very hot water, then wring well.  This procedure is not necessary if the
  crust is baked, since it will slide out easily by itself.
  
  Filling Instructions:
  In a large saucepan combine the chocolate, cream, butter, and Kahlua and
  heat the mixture over moderately low heat, stirring until it is smooth.
  Remove from heat, allow to cool for 30 minutes at room temperature. Pour
  into cooled tart shell and refrigerate for at least 3 hours.
  
  Sauce Instructions:
  In a saucepan, combine cream, sugar, and butter.  Cook over low
  heat,stirring frequently, until mixture boils.  Boil 5 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.  Remove from heat.  Stir in expresso grounds. To serve,
  spoon a moderate amount of warm sauce on a rimmed plate. Top with a wedge
  of tart.
  
  Whipped Cream (Alternative) Instructions:
  Whip cream until the consistency of pudding. Gradually add the powdered
  sugar, beating until soft peaks form. Gradually drizzle in the Kahlua,
  beating until desired consistency is obtained.

      1 lb Belgian bittersweet choc.
      6 ea Egg yolk
      8 ea Egg white
    1/2 c  Sugar

----------------------------------GANACHE-----------------------------------
      6 oz Belgian bittersweet choc.
    2/3 c  Whipping cream

----------------------------------GARNISH-----------------------------------
    1/2 c  Almonds, toasted chopped
           Almonds, sliced; addl
     10 ea Hazelnuts, whole; to 12
 
  Note: Meringue layer and Genoise may be prepared well in advance. Just
  before assembling, prepare Chocolate Mousse and Ganache.
  
  Meringue:  Combine egg whites and sugar in the top of a double boiler.
  Heat to lukewarm.  Remove from heat.  Pour into mixing bowl and beat about
  15 minutes at medium speed, until stiff.  Quickly fold in the cocoa to
  prevent the meringue from falling.  Grease a 10" springform pan, line with
  parchment paper, and grease again.  Pipe meringue through a pastry bag
  using the round tube, forming a spiral on the bottom of the springform
  pan, starting from the center and working out toward the sides until the
  bottom is completely covered.  Bake at 250 degrees for 2 hours.  Allow to
  cool in the pan.
  
  Genoise:  Grease a 10" x 3" round baking pan, line with baking parchment,
  and grease again.  Combine beaten eggs and sugar in the top of the double
  boiler.  Heat to lukewarm.  Remove from the heat.  Pour into a mixing bowl
  and beat on high speed about 10 minutes, or until the batter forms a
  ribbon.  Sift the flour and cocoa into the batter and fold to combine.
  Fold in the butter.  Pour into the prepared pan and bake at 350 degrees 35
  to 40 minutes, or until the cake springs back when lightly touched and a
  toothpick comes out clean.  Cool thoroughly.  Remove from pan.
  
  Mousse:  Melt chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering
  water.  Remove pan from the heat and cool.  Beat in the egg yolks, one at
  a time.  Beat the egg whites until soft peaks form.  Lightly fold a
  quarter of the beaten egg whites into the chocolate.  Fold in the
  remaining egg whites, lightly but thoroughly.  Chill.
  
  Ganache:  Heat chocolate and cream together in the top of the double
  boiler over simmering water until the chocolate melts.  Blend well.
  
  Assembly:  Spoon half the ganache over the meringue layer in the pan and
  smooth evenly over the surface.  Cut the chocolate Genoise into two 1/4"
  slices, reserving the rest of the cake for another use. Place one slice
  over the ganache and meringue layer.  Cover with about half the mousse.
  Top with the second layer of cake.  Spoon the remaining mousse over the
  cake and chill until set, at least four to six hours.
  
  Just before serving, spoon remaining ganache on the cake. Carefully line
  the sides of the cake with chopped toasted almonds. Decorate the top with
  hazelnut roses by placing the whole hazelnuts evenly around the top of the
  cake, then place almond slices around each hazelnut to resemble petals.

  NOTE: To make chocolate leaves, melt unsweetened, semi-sweet or sweet
  cooking chocolate or vanilla-flavored candy coating. Brush melted
  chocolate evenly on underside of washed and dried non-toxic leaves (ivy,
  mint, lemon, or rose leaves). Wipe off any chocolate that may have dripped
  onto front side of leaf. Refrigerate leaves about 10 minutes or until
  chocolate is set. Brush second layer of chocolate over first layer.
  Refrigerate until chocolate is set. Carefully peel leaf away from
  chocolate; discard leaf. Store in refrigerator or freezer until ready to
  use.

      Title: Death By Chocolate Help
 Categories: Tips, Trellis, Dessert, Cake
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           -The Chefs Touch!
 
  You will not find the recipe for Death by Chocolate in a
  culinary lexicon. It is a contemporary concoction, an amalgam of
  cocoa meringue, chocolate mousse, chocolate ganache, chocolate
  brownie and mocha mousse, structured in an extraordinary, albeit
  sound manner.
  
  A fair warning must be issued that this is a time and money
  consuming recipe. It is best to start work on this cake very
  early in the day if it is to be served that evening.
  
  Death by Chocolate may be held for two to three days under
  refrigeration, but it is at its best when served within 24 hours
  of completion. The preparation in one day of all the chocolate
  components of this cake might seem overwhelming. To prepare in
  advance, spread the production out over a period of three days.
  
  Day 1: Prepare the chocolate brownie and keep refrigerated until
  cake assembly.
  
  Day 2:  Bake the cocoa meringue and store in a dry place at room
  temperature (between 68 and 78 degrees). Prepare the chocolate
  rum sauce, refrigerate until two hours before service, then
  bring to room temperature.
  
  Day 3: Prepare the chocolate mousse, mocha mousse and ganache.
  Assemble cake. Use the 9 inch bottom of the springform pan to
  trace the circle onto parchment paper. Be certain that the
  meringue completely fills the traced circle. If the meringue is
  not large enough, the sides of the cake will be uneven. Do not
  be concerned if the meringue slightly overlaps the circle.; any
  excess may be trimmed off after the meringue has been baked.
  Baked meringues are very brittle; handle with care. Use a very
  sharp serrated knife to trim the meringue; otherwise the
  meringue will break apart.
  
  If the mocha mousse is prepared several hours in advance of the
  assembly of the cake, it should be refrigerated  until 1 to
  1.1/2 hours before assembly, at which time it should be allowed
  to temper at room temperature (if it is too cold it will be too
  difficult to spread evenly over the delicate mocha meringue).
  
  If the ganache solidifies, place the bowl containing the ganache
  in a pan of hot water and stir until the texture is correct for
  pouring.
  
  Use several toothpicks inserted in the sides of the chocolate
  brownie as guides to accurately halve the brownie horizontally.
  
  The preparations may also be completed using a hand held mixer,
  but preparation time may increase slightly.
  
  For organizational and shopping convenience the following is a
  compilation of all the ingredients needed to produce Death By
  Chocolate
  
  2  pounds, 13 ounces semisweet chocolate
  5.1/2  ounces unsweetened chocolate
  4.3/4  cups heavy cream
  3.1/4 cups granulated sugar
  2  teaspoons pure vanilla extract
  15  eggs
  15 Tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon ( almost 1/2 pound) unsalted butter
  10  Tablespoons cocoa

  2  teaspoons pure vanilla extract
  2  teaspoons dark rum
  3/4 teaspoon salt

      Title: Deep Dark Chocolate Fudge Cookies
 Categories: Chocolate, Death by ch, Cookie
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           -(Includes the recipe for
           -Absolutely Deep Dark)
 
  Makes 3 to 3.1/2 dozen
  
  1.1/2 cups all-purpose flour
  1/2 cup Nestle unsweetened cocoa
  1 teaspoon baking soda
  1 teaspoon salt
  8 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, broken into 1/2 ounce pieces
  4 ounces unsweetened chocolate, broken into 1/2 ounce pieces
  1.1/2 cups tightly packed light brown sugar (12 ounces)
  12 Tablespoons unsalted butter
  3 eggs
  1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
  
  Absolutely Deep Dark:
  
  3 cups semisweet chocolate chips
  
  Equipment:
  Measuring cups\Measuring spoons
  sifter
  waxed paper
  double boiler
  film wrap
  whisk
  electric mixer with paddle
  rubber spatula (see my note)
  2 non-stick baking sheets
  flexible pancake turner
  cooling rack
  plastic container with lid
  
  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.
  Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt onto waxed
  paper. Set aside.
  Heat 1 inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over
  medium heat. Place the semisweet and the unsweetened chocolates
  in the top half of the double boiler. Tightly cover the top with
  the film wrap and allow to heat for 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from
  the heat and stir until smooth. Keep at room temperature until
  needed.
  Place the light brown sugar and butter in the bowl of an electric
  mixer fitted with a paddle. Beat on medium for 1 minute. Scrape
  down the bowl and beat on high for an additional 30 seconds.
  Scrape down the bowl. Add the eggs, one at a time, while beating
  on medium, and stopping to scrape down the bowl after
  incorporating each addition. Add the vanilla extract and beat on
  medium for 30 seconds. Add the melted chocolate and beat on low
  for 10 seconds more. Scrape down the bowl and beat for an
  additional 30 seconds. Add the sifted flour, cocoa and baking
  soda (also add the chocolate chips if making the Absolutely Deep
  Dark Chocolate Fudge Cookies) and beat on low until thoroughly
  combined, about 20-30 seconds. Remove the bowl from the mixer and
  mix thoroughly with a rubber spatula.
  Portion 6-8 cookies per baking sheet by dropping 2 level
  Tablespoons of batter per cookie onto each of the two baking
  sheets. Place the cookies on the top and middle shelves of the
  preheated oven and bake for 18-22 minutes, rotating the sheets
  from top to bottom about halfway through the baking time. Allow
  the cookies to cool for 5-6 minutes on the baking sheets.
  Transfer the cookies to a cooling rack to thoroughly cool before
  
  storing in a sealed plastic container. Repeat this procedure
  until all the cookies have been baked.
  
  The Chef's Touch:
  
  If a nocturnal lust for chocolate has you making furtive
  movements towards the kitchen, I suggest a few Absolutely Deep
  Dark Chocolate Fudge Cookies, each one dipped into your favorite
  chocolate ganache. It is a fact that this confection will assuage
  even the most passionate chocophile, regardless of the hour.
  
  I have specified Nestle cocoa for this recipe because it delivers
  the deep dark chocolate flavor implied by the name of the cookie.
  
  If you are making Absolutely Deep Dark Chocolate Fudge Cookies
  (and I highly recommend that you do so) the yield will remain the
  same - about 3 to 3.1/2 dozen cookies.
  
  The cookies will be crisp around the edges following baking and
  cooling. Storing in an airtight plastic container after cooling
  will reduce the crispness of the cookies. Decide which texture
  you prefer and store accordingly (in or out of a sealed
  container).
  This cookie was made for traveling, do not hesitate to send them
  to chocophiles everywhere.
  
  Cookie-Lady's note! Make sure the rubber spatula is a strong
  rubber one. I did break mine stirring the batter <g>
  
  These cookies are to die for!

  1 1/2 ts Vanilla
      2 tb Half-and-half OR milk OR
           - evaporated milk
 
   PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 350F. Grease 2 8-inch layer cake
  pans well, then dust them generously with cocoa. (This
  gives the cake layers a rich brown finish). Sift the
  flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt onto a piece of
  waxed paper and set it aside. Cream the butter until
  it is fluffy, add the sugar and vanilla, and continue
  beating until the batter is silvery and light. Beat
  the eggs in one by one, then add the sifted dry
  ingredients, alternately with the boiling water,
  beginning and ending with the dry ingredients and
  beating well after each addition. Divide the batter
  equally between the two pans, smoothing the tops. Bake
  the layers uncovered for 30 to 35 minutes, or until
  the layers feel spongy to the touch and begin to pull
  away from the sides of the pans. Cool the layers
  upright in their pans on wire racks for 10 minutes,
  then carefully loosen them around the edges with a
  spatula and turn them onto wire racks. Cool them
  completely. FOR THE FROSTING: Cream the butter until
  it is light, then add the confectioners' sugar
  gradually, beating all the while. Beat in the melted
  chocolate and vanilla, then add just enough cream to
  make the frosting a good consistency for spreading.
   Sandwich the two cake layers together with frosting,
  then frost the top and sides of the cake. Swirl the
  frosting into peaks and valleys.

      Title: Dirty Snowballs
 Categories: Cookie
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
      2 c  Sugar, granulated
      4 oz Chocolate, unsweetened
      4    Eggs
      2 t  Vanilla
      2 t  Baking powder
      2 c  Flour
      1 c  Sugar, powdered
 
  Melt chocolate in double boiler or microwave.  Combine melted chocolate,
  granulated sugar, vanilla and vegetable oil in a mixer.
  
  Add eggs, one at a time, blending well each time.  Sift (or stir) together
  flour and baking powder, add to wet mixture.  Mix well.
  
  Let stand in refrigerator for a few hours or overnight.  Roll dough into
  small balls (no more than about 1 inch in diameter), and roll in powdered
  sugar until coated. Bake for 12 minutes in a preheated 350 degree F. oven.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chocolate cookies with powdered sugar coating -- This recipe was handed
  down to me from my step-sister who got it from her mother. Yield: Several
  dozen.
  
  *  The temperature is very important:  any lower and the cookies won't bake
  properly; any higher and the powdered sugar will glaze.
  
  *  If you coat your palms with powdered sugar before attempting to roll the
  balls your hands will get less sticky.  Put the dough back in the
  refrigerator whenever you are not actively using it; it is easier to work
  when cold.
  
  *  You don't actually have to bake these; they make a reasonable fudge when
  left uncooked, but if left in the refrigerator for several days before
  baking they will become dried out. When done, the unused powdered sugar
  will have small shards of chocolate in it; these can be strained out and
  the sugar will be re-usable.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, overnight chilling, 20 minutes baking and
  cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Yield: 1 Pie
 
    1/2 c  Butter
      2 oz Chocolate, unsweetened
      1 c  Sugar
      3    Eggs, lightly beaten
    1/4 c  Creme de cacao liqueur

  NOTES:
  
  *  A rich chocolate pie -- I got this recipe from a 1983 calendar. It's
  tried and true and delicious. It's also very simple to make. I usually
  double the recipe, since one pie never seems to last long enough. Maybe
  that makes it a double double chocolate pie. I've made it using chocolate
  almond liqueur instead of creme de cacao. It came out OK, and had a hint of
  a nutty flavor in the background.

----------------------------SAN FRANCISCO ENCORE----------------------------

------------------------------------CAKE------------------------------------
      1 lb Sweet chocolate
      6 oz Unsalted butter; 1.1/2 stick
      4    Eggs
      1 tb Sugar
      1 tb Flour

------------------------------RASPBERRY SAUCE------------------------------
      8 oz Raspberries; fresh or frozen
           Superfine sugar; to taste
      1 c  Heavy cream
      1 ts Vanilla
           Fresh raspberries
 
  Cake - preheat oven to 400~.  Line an 8" cake pan with
  parchment paper.
  
  In a saucepan, melt the chocolate and butter over low
  heat.  Place uncracked eggs in a bowl of hot water for
  5 mins.  Crack and combine the eggs and sugar in the
  bowl of an electric mixer.  Beat on high speed for 8
  to 10 mins., or until tripled in volume.  Sift the
  flour on top.  Fold into the eggs.  Stir 1/4 of the
  egg mixture into the chocolate.  Carefully fold the
  chocolate into the remaining eggs until thoroughly
  combined. Pour into the prepared pan.  Bake for 20
  mins.  The cake will still be slightly soft in the
  middle.  Cool completely in the pan.  Cover and
  refrigerate in the pan overnight.  The cake can be
  frozen for two weeks at this point.
  
  Sauce - puree the 8-oz. raspberries and strain.  Add
  enough sugar to sweeten.  Whip the heavy cream with
  the vanilla until firm.  Invert the cake onto a
  platter and cut into wedges.  Spoon some of the
  raspberry sauce onto the bottom of a dessert plate.
  Place a wedge of the cake in the center of the sauce.
  Spoon a dollop of whipped cream on top of the cake.
  Form a circle with the raspberries around the wedge.

      Title: Double-Frosted Brownies
 Categories: Cookie
      Yield: 1 Dozen
 
-----------------------------------BATTER-----------------------------------
      2 oz Chocolate, unsweetened
           -(2 squares)
    1/4 lb Butter
      2 lg Eggs
      1 c  Sugar
      1 t  Vanilla extract
    1/2 c  Flour
    1/4 t  Salt
    1/2 c  Nuts, chopped
           -(walnuts are traditional)

-------------------------------FIRST FROSTING-------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
    1/3 c  Butter
    1/2 c  Half-and-half (also
           -called light cream)
      1 t  Vanilla extract

------------------------------SECOND FROSTING------------------------------
      3 oz Chocolate, unsweetened
           -(3 squares)
 
  Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F.  Melt about 2 oz of chocolate and the
  butter in a heavy saucepan, then let it cool. Be careful not to let the
  chocolate burn.
  
  Beat the eggs in a large bowl until they are blended.  Add about 1 cup 200
  g of sugar and mix well. Stir in chocolate-and-butter mixture. Mix until
  the chocolate is fully incorporated, with no streakiness. Add the vanilla,
  flour, salt and nuts. Stir just until the flour is incorporated;
  over-stirring will make a tough brownie.
  
  Spread the mixture in a greased pan, about 11 x 7 inches, that is about 1
  1/2 inches deep. Bake in pre-heated oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the
  pan on a rack. While it is cooling, follow these instructions to make the
  first frosting:
  
  Mix about 1 1/2 cups sugar, about 1/3 cup butter and about 1/2 cup of
  half-and-half in a heavy, medium-size saucepan.  Bring to a boil, then cook
  over moderate heat without stirring until a small amount of the mixture
  forms a soft ball when dropped in ice water, or it reaches 236 degrees F.
  on a candy thermometer.
  
  Remove from heat immediately and cool in a pan of ice-water until the candy
  is lukewarm. DANGER: melted sugar cools very slowly. You can burn yourself
  badly by testing it with your finger.
  
  Add about 1 teaspoon vanilla extract to the candy.  Beat it until it is
  creamy and of a spreading consistency. This is most easily done with an
  electric mixer, although you can use a heavy wire whip. Spread the frosting
  over the brownies.
  
  Melt the remaining 3 oz chocolate and spread over the frosting just put on
  the brownies. Cover as evenly as possible. Cool for several hours in a
  refrigerator, then bring to room temperature and cut into pieces to serve.
  
  Be very careful when melting chocolate.  It burns easily.  A double boiler
  is probably the best way thing to use.
  
  It is critical to cook the first frosting to just the right point.  If
  cooked too little, it will be too thin to beat to a creamy consistency. If
  cooked too much, it will be too brittle. So keep a close eye on it; sugar
  tends to cook slowly to the soft-ball stage, then it cooks quickly.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Very rich brownies with double frosting -- This recipe is for people who
  like intense chocolate flavor.  The result is a brownie with a fondant
  frosting, covered with unsweetened chocolate.  They are very rich, with an
  interesting combination of textures.  This recipe is not for beginners.
  
  : Difficulty:  difficult.
  : Time:  a few hours preparation, several hours chilling and then warming
  : Precision:  measure ingredients carefully.

      Title: Dur Mou
 Categories: Dessert
      Yield: 8 servings
 
     11 oz Dark German chocolate
      2    Sticks sweet butter
      1 c  Superfine sugar
      9    Egg yolks
           Pinch salt
      5    Egg whites
 
    Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Melt the chocolate
  with the butter in the top of a double boiler set over
  simmering water.  Beat the sugar with the egg yolks
  until smooth.  Mix this with the chocolate away from
  the heat, adding it gradually.  Beat the egg whites in
  a clean bowl with a tiny pinch of salt until stiff.
  Using a metal spoon, fold the egg whites into the
  chocolate mixture gently but thoroughly.
    Have prepared a pair of 7-1/4 skillets oiled or
  lined with non-stick baking parchment.  Divide
  approximately two-thirds of the batter between the two
  skillets, place into oven and bake for 1 hour.
  Reserve the rest of cake batter/mousse and place in
  refrigerator.
    Once the cakes are baked, cool them then chill them
  in the skillets. Take the reserved mousse from the
  refrigerator and spoon it carefully over one of the
  cakes (both now removed from their skillets).  Put the
  other cake on top, to sandwich the two halves
  together.  This ends up something between a souffle
  and a squidgy cake.  It is wickedly rich - thus the 8
  servings. :) From The Country Cook's Companion by

      Title: Ebony and Ivory Chocolate Truffles
 Categories: Chocolate, Truffles, Death by ch, Candy
      Yield: 1 servings
 
  7 1/2 oz White chocolate, chopped
           -into 1/4 inch pieces
      8 oz Semi-sweet chocolate,
           -chopped into 1/4 inch
           -pieces
    3/4 c  Heavy cream
      5 T  Unsweetened cocoa
 
  Equipment:
  Cutting board
  Cooks knife
  Measuring cup
  Measuring spoons
  2 stainless steel bowls
  1.1/2 quart saucepan
  2 whisks
  Baking sheet
  Parchment paper
  
  Place the white and dark chocolates into separate stainless steel
  bowls. Heat the cream in a 1.1/2 quart saucepan over medium heat.
  Bring to a boil. Pour 1/4 cup boiling cream over the white
  chocolate and the remaining 1/2 cup over the dark chocolate and
  allow to stand for 4 to 5 minutes. Stir each with a separate
  whisk until smooth, and allow to cool for 1 hour at room
  temperature. Refrigerate the two ganaches for 15 minutes,
  stirring every 5 minutes.
  
  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Portion 36 heaping
  teaspoons of dark chocolate into separate mounds onto the
  parchment paper. Top each teaspoon of dark chocolate with a level
  teaspoon of white chocolate.
  To fashion the truffles, roll each portion of chocolate in your
  palms in a gentle circular motion using just enough pressure to
  from smooth rounds.
  
  Roll the rounds of chocolate in cocoa until completely covered.
  
  Note: If the heat of the cream is not sufficient to thoroughly
  melt the chocolate, or if the chocolate does not completely
  dissolve while you are stirring, then place the bowl of chocolate
  over very hot water (not simmering or boiling) and continue to
  stir to a smooth texture.
  
  Frequently wipe your hands clean during the process of rolling
  the truffles. Some candy makers suggest dusting the palms of your
  hands with cocoa powder.
  It is easier to completely cover the truffles with cocoa if they
  are rolled around in a substantial amount. The remaining 4 to
  4.1/2 Tablespoons of cocoa may be sifted and used for other uses.
  
  In place of cocoa you may enrobe the truffles with several other
  coatings: Deep Dark Chocolate Fudge Cookie Crumbs, finely chopped
  nuts (macadamia nuts are terrific), shredded coconut or the
  Ultimate Chocolate Ganache. Another ploy for candy makers is to
  place a pistachio or hazelnut in the center of the chocolate-
  truffle mixture and roll the chocolate around the nut.
  The truffles may be refrigerated for several days before serving.
  Do, however, bring the truffles to room temperature before
  offering them to your guests (this will take 15-20 minutes)
  
  If the truffles absorb the cocoa during refrigeration, simply
  roll them in more cocoa before serving.

      Title: Ed's Peanut Butter Fudge
 Categories: Candy
      Yield: 3 Pounds
 
      1 lb Peanut butter, smooth
           -(natural)
      1 lb Sugar, powdered
    1/2 lb Butter (2 sticks,
           -save the wrappers)
      1 ts Vanilla extract
     12 oz Chocolate, semi-sweet
           -(otherwise known as
           -1 bag chocolate chips)
 
  Melt the chocolate in a bowl over hot water or the top of a double boiler.
  Make sure you don't get even a drop of water in the chocolate. Stir
  frequently with a spatula while doing the following steps and remove it
  from the hot water just as soon as it's melted.
  
  Melt the butter.  Mix together the powdered sugar, the melted butter and
  the vanilla. Don't bother sifting the powdered sugar. Just stir everything
  together with a wooden spoon until it's smooth and creamy. Stir in the
  peanut butter. This will break most flimsy wooden spoons if you're not
  careful. Mushing everything together with your hands works well and is lots
  of fun.
  
  Press the fudge into a buttered 8 or 9 square pan.  You don't need much
  butter, just wipe the butter papers over the inside of the pan. You can
  also line the pan with foil and butter that; this works especially well if
  you're making several batches in a row to give to people as holiday
  presents. Press the fudge in firmly; you don't want any air bubbles in it.
  You will get your hands messy here.
  
  Pour the chocolate over the fudge and spread it in an even layer.  The
  easiest way to do this is to shake the pan gently until the chocolate is
  even.  Let the chocolate cool to room temperature. DO NOT PUT IT IN THE
  REFRIGERATOR.
  
  Using a sharp knife cut the fudge into 1 squares.  If you defied my
  instructions and put it in the refrigerator, the chocolate layer will
  shatter when you try to cut it. Unless you are going to serve it
  immediately, store it in the refrigerator. Let it come to room temperature
  before serving.
  
  Again, don't scrimp on the peanut butter!  Skippy simply will not do.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An extremely rich candy -- I got this recipe from a friend, Ed
  Firestone, who is arguably the best cook in Palo Alto. The results resemble
  Reese's Peanut Butter Cups that have attained Nirvana. Don't scrimp on the
  peanut butter; get the best you can find or make it yourself. If there's
  anything besides peanuts and salt in it, find another brand.
  
  *  Unless you use the foil method, you will inevitably destroy at least one
  piece getting it out of the pan.  The best method is to line the pan with
  foil, let the fudge cool, lift it out, peel off the foil, put it back in
  the pan and cut it. This keeps it from sticking to the pan. If you try to
  cut it out of the pan, it tends to fall apart.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 15 minutes cooling.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      6 oz White chocolate; chopped
           -fine
    1/2 c  Fresh red raspberries; at
           -room temperature
 
  Recipe by: Felicia Pickering <MNHAN063@SIVM.SI.EDU> 1. Brownie: Position a
  rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 325 F. Line an 8-inch
  square baking pan with a double thickness of aluminum foil so that the foil
  extends 2 inches beyond two of the opposite ends of the pan. Fold the
  overhang down to form "handles." Butter the bottom of the foil-lined pan.
  Sift flour, baking soda, and salt through a wire strainer onto a sheet of
  wax paper.
  
  2. In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt butter.  Off heat, add
  chocolate and let stand 1 minute; whisk until smooth.  Pour into a large
  bowl, and let stand 5 minutes, until tepid.  Whisk in sugars and corn
  syrup.  Whisk in eggs, then vanilla.  Using a wooden spoon, stir in flour
  mixture, just until blended.  Using a rubber spatula, carefully fold in
  raspberries.
  
  3. Spread batter evenly into prepared pan and bake 25 to 30 minutes, until
  a toothpick inserted 1 inch from the edge of the brownie comes out with a
  moist crumb.  Cool on a wire cake rack for 10 minutes. Invert onto the wire
  cake rack, carefully peel off aluminum foil, and cool completely.
  
  4. White Chocolate Raspberry Topping:  In the top part of a double boiler,
  over hot, not simmering, water, melt butter.  (Water should be no warmer
  than 125 F.)  Add white chocolate and melt, stirring often until smooth.
  Transfer to a small bowl, and let stand 10 minutes, until tepid and
  slightly thickened.  Using a metal cake spatula, spread half of the topping
  onto the top of the brownie. Freeze brownie for 5 minutes, just until
  topping is partially set. Using a sharp knife, mark topping of brownie into
  16 squares.  Using a rubber spatula, carefully fold remaining 1/2 cup
  raspberries into remaining topping. Divide white chocolate-coated
  raspberries evenly among brownies, arranging them attractively on top of
  each square. Loosely cover brownies with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for
  30 minutes to set topping completely. Using a sharp knife, cut through
  markings into 16 squares.  Transfer brownies to a serving plate and cover
  tightly with plastic wrap.  Brownies can be made up to 1 day ahead,
  refrigerated, and covered with plastic wrap.  Bring to room temperature
  before serving

           -cake is about right)
      3 T  Sugar, powdered (or more
           -or less, to taste)
      3 c  Whipping cream
    1/4 c  Spirits (rum, amaretto
           -or whatever you like;
           -see below for quantity)
           Assorted flavorings
           -(chocolate, nuts, coffee,
           -liqueurs, extracts...)
      2 t  Gelatin, unflavored
           -(optional)
 
  Line a large hemispherical bowl with the cake or lady fingers.  If you use
  cake, cut slices in half diagonally to make large triangles and arrange
  them in a sunburst pattern. If you use lady fingers, cut some in half
  diagonally and arrange in a flower-like pattern. Douse generously with
  spirits; cake should be quite wet but not soggy.
  
  Dissolve the gelatin in 2 tablespoons hot water in a cup; place the cup in
  a bowl of very hot water so the gelatin melts. Check occasionally to make
  sure the surrounding water stays hot. (I suppose you could use a microwave
  for this, but I've never tried.)
  
  Divide the cream into two very cold bowls.  Whip each until stiff; if the
  flavoring for either half isn't sweet, add powdered sugar to taste at this
  point.  Beat the dissolved gelatin into the cream. Flavor each half
  separately.  Spread one half around the inside of the cake-lined bowl; fill
  with the other half.
  
  Top with more cake and douse with more spirits.  Since this part doesn't
  show you don't need to be creative. Cover with plastic wrap and chill
  overnight.
  
  Turn out onto a platter and garnish with chopped nuts, grated chocolate, or
  powdered sugar if desired.  Cut into wedges; serves about 10-20 people
  depending.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Ladyfingers with cream and rum -- This makes a great dessert for a
  party. It only takes about an hour to make (more if you bake a cake
  yourself instead of buying one) and only requires a few seconds to get
  ready when served. Yield: Serves 10-20.
  
  *  The most recent zuccotto I made used rum to flavor the lady fingers. The
  first filling had powdered sugar, vanilla extract and about 1 1/2 oz
  chopped semi-sweet chocolate. The second had about 5 oz melted semi-sweet
  chocolate mixed with about 2 t instant coffee dissolved in a little boiling
  water, and another 1 1/2 oz chopped semi-sweet chocolate. (Just chop 3 of
  the squares of chocolate and melt the other 5). Chopped hazelnuts or
  almonds are also quite good.
  
  *  You can make a smaller one by using less, of course!

      Title: Frango Mint Pie
 Categories: Pie
      Yield: 1 Pie
 
      1 c  Butter
      2 c  Sugar, confectioner's
           -(sifted)
      4 oz Chocolate, unsweetened
      4    Eggs
    3/4 t  Peppermint extract
      2 t  Vanilla extract
     10    Vanilla wafers,
           -crushed
 
  Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy.
  
  In the top of a double boiler, melt the chocolate.  Add to the butter-sugar
  mixture and beat thoroughly.  Add the eggs one at a time, beating well
  after each egg, until well blended. Fold in the peppermint and vanilla.
  
  Line the pie tin with the vanilla wafer crumbs (buttering the pie tin makes
  them stick to the side a little better).  Pour in the filling. Refrigerate
  for two hours.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Decadent chocolate mint pie -- One of the things that is memorable about
  Marshall Field's department store in Chicago is their "Frango chocolate
  mints."  This pie captures the flavor perfectly.  I got the recipe from
  Malcolm Slaney, who "found it in a cookbook when [he was] attending Kayak
  School in Oregon."
  
  *  This recipe fills a shallow 8 inch pie tin; add 50 percent to everything
  to fill a 9-inch pie tin.
  
  *  If you're not very good at pie crusts (I'm not), feel free to use a
  pre-formed graham cracker crust.  The chocolate and mint flavors
  predominate, no matter what crust you use.
  
  *  This is serious decadence! The first time I made this, I stopped several
  times in disbelief of just what I was doing.  Enjoy!

      Yield: 1 Cake
 
------------------------------------CAKE------------------------------------
      2 t  Espresso coffee,
           -instant
    1/4 c  Water, hot
      7 oz Chocolate, semisweet
      2 oz Chocolate, bitter
      4    Eggs, separated
      4 oz Butter
    2/3 c  Sugar
    1/4 t  Cream of tartar
    3/4 c  Cornstarch, sifted

----------------------------------FROSTING----------------------------------
      2 t  Espresso coffee,
           -instant
      7 oz Chocolate, semisweet
      2 oz Chocolate, bitter
      2 T  Butter
 
  Combine espresso, hot water, semisweet chocolate and bitter chocolate in
  double boiler filled with hot water and cover.  Without applying additional
  heat, melt the chocolate.
  
  Butter two layer-cake pans, lay a sheet of waxed paper in each, and dust
  the pans with flour. (The pans should be able to hold about 4 cups each.)
  
  Beat the egg yolks and then gradually add about 2/3 cup of sugar until the
  yolks are thick and lemon colored.
  
  Beat butter into the chocolate mixture.  Add the chocolate mixture to the
  egg yolks and stir.
  
  Beat the egg whites until foamy.  Add the cream of tartar, and then
  gradually add up to 2 T sugar.
  
  Add the sifted corn starch gradually to the chocolate mixture, alternating
  with the egg whites.  The corn starch and egg whites should be folded in to
  the chocolate mixture.
  
  Pour half the batter into each cake pan.  Bake on the lower middle level of
  a preheated 350 degree F. oven until set on the sides. Cool the cake in the
  pan, and then turn out onto a serving dish.
  
  Combine the icing ingredients and ice the cake as you would a normal layer
  cake.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A decadently rich chocolate cake -- My mother got this recipe from a
  radio show about ten years ago. She was intrigued because the cake contains
  no flour. It is definitely for chocoholics. Although it is a two-layer
  cake, it is only about 3-4 inches thick when it's done, and has the
  consistency and density of a chocolate candy bar. It can be frozen if you
  find it too much to eat at one time.

  2 1/4 ts Baking powder
    3/4 ts Baking soda
    3/4 ts Salt
  1 1/2 c  Milk
      3    Eggs
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
      4 oz Unsweetened chocolate
      6 oz Butter; softened
 
  Recipe by: kdeck@epaus.island.net (Karen Deck)
  :       PREPARATION:  FROSTING.  Chop both chocolates into coarse bits and
  melt in a double boiler set over hot (not boiling) water.  Stir
  occasionally until completely melted.  Remove pan from hot water and allow
  the chocolate to cool until just no longer warm to the touch, about 20
  minutes.  Place the butter in a bowl and beat in the cooled chocolate until
  the mixture is evenly blended, about 3 minutes.
  
  :       Frosting can be stored at a cool temperature for up to 3 days, or
  several months in the freezer.
  
  :         Heat the oven to 350F.  Butter two 9-inch round cake pans and
  line them with buttered and floured parchment paper or waxed paper.
  
  :       FUDGE CAKE.  Sift the flour.  Measure 3 cups.  In a large bowl, mix
  together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, breaking
  up any lumps of sugar.
  
  :       In a small bowl, whisk about 1/2 cup of the milk with the eggs and
  vanilla; set aside.  Chop the chocolate into coarse bits and melt in a
  double boiler set over hot (not boiling) water.  Combine the remaining cup
  of milk and the butter with the mixed dry ingredients and beat for 1 1/2
  minutes, scraping the sides of the bowl twice.  Add the egg mixture in 3
  parts, scraping the sides of the bowl and beating for 20 seconds after each
  addition.  Add the melted chocolate and beat until just incorporated.
  
  :       Pour the batter into the prepared pans and bake in the center of
  the preheated oven until the cake springs back when lightly pressed in the
  center, 25 to 30 minutes.  Cool the cakes in their pans for 10 minutes and
  invert onto racks.  Cool completely before frosting.
  
  :       Frost the top surface of one layer of cake and top with the second
  layer.  Spread the remaining frosting on the top and sides of the cake.
  Make a decorative pattern zigzag in the frosting by pulling a serrated
  knife across the surface in a back-and-forth motion.  Use a small spatula
  or spoon handle to pull out spikes of frosting all around the sides.
  
  :       Cake can be completed a day ahead and refrigerated.
  
         SERVING:  Return to room temperature if refrigerated.  Cut into
  wedges and serve.
  
  Makes one 9-inch cake.

      Yield: 12 servings
 
 
  In the 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer using the paddle
  attachment, beat the cream cheese at low speed for 30 to 45 seconds, until
  creamy. Gradually add the sugar in a steady stream and beat at medium speed
  until blended. At low speed, one at a time, add the eggs, beating well afte
  each addition. Slowly beat in the reserved 2 cups of chocolate ganache. Bea
  in the cornstarch mixture. Pour the filling into the prepared pan and, usin
  Bake the cheesecake for 1 hour and 15 minutes to 1 hour and 20 minutes, or
  until the center is set. (There will probably be cracks in the top of the
  cheesecake; they will shrink as the cheesecake cools and then will be cover
  with the ganache frosting.) Turn off the oven. Prop open the oven door with
  wooden spoon and allow the cheesecake to cool in the oven for an hour.
   Set the cheesecake in the pan on a wire rack and cool completely.
  
   Make the chocolate truffles: Transfer the chilled 1 cup ganache to a
  pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip (such as Ateco #6). Pipe l-inch
  mounds with pointed peaks onto a clean baking sheet. Refrigerate or freeze
  the truffles for 15 to 20 minutes or until just firm enough to roll.
   Sift a light dusting of confectioners' sugar over the truffles. Lightly
  coat your palms and fingertips with confectioners' sugar. With your
  fingertips, pinch a truffle into a round, then roll it gently between your
  palms into a round ball. Place the truffle on the baking sheet, and form th
  remaining truffles into rounds. Refrigerate or freeze for about 10 minutes,
  just until firm.
   Roll the truffles in sifted cocoa powder to coat. Refrigerate.
  
   Decorate the cheesecake: Run a thin-bladed knife around the edge of the
  cheesecake to loosen it from the side of the springform pan. Remove the
  side of the pan. Slide two metal cake spatulas under the cheesecake and
  transfer it to a serving platter.
   Using a metal cake spatula, spread the reserved room-temperature chocolate
  ganache evenly over the top and sides of the cheesecake. Place the chocolat
  truffles around the outside edge of the top of the cheesecake, spacing them
  evenly.
   Melt the white chocolate according to the instructions in the Chocolate Ke
  Using a fork, drizzle/shake the warm white chocolate in a decorative zigzag
  pattern over the top of the cheesecake.
   Refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 6 hours, or overnight, before
  serving. (The cheesecake can be prepared ahead and refrigerated for up to 5
  days.)  Remove the cheesecake from the refrigerator 30 minutes before servi
  With a sharp, thin-bladed knife, cut the cheesecake into 12 truffle-topped
  slices, dipping the blade in hot water and wiping it dry after each slice.

  Cream Filling:  Sprinkle 1 tsp. unflavored gelatine onto 5 Tbsp.
  water in saucepan; let stand a few minutes to soften.  Cook over
  medium heat, stirring constantly, until gelatine is dissolved.
  Remove from heat; add 1-1/2 eight-ounce milk chocolate bars, broken
  into pieces (reserve remaining half for glaze).  Stir until chocolate

  stiff; gradually add whipped cream to chocolate mixture, blending
  carefully.  Chill about 1 hour or until filling begins to set.
  
  Glaze:  Melt 1/2 milk chocolate bar (reserved from filling) with 1
  Tbsp. water in top of double boiler over warm water, stir to blend
  well.  Add teaspoonfuls of water as needed until glaze is of
  spreading consistency.

  Recipe by: Hershey's 'Great American Desserts'
  Adjust a rack to the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 350
  degrees. Line the inside of a 9 inch square pan with aluminium foil, shiny
  side in. Put a piece of butter (in addition to that called for above) in
  the foil, and then place the pan in the oven to melt the butter. Once the
  butter is melted, spread it all over the inside of  the foil with a pastry
  brush. Set the pan aside.  Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking powder
  and salt. Set aside.  Melt the butter and stir in the granulated sugar and
  vanilla. Then add
  the eggs, one at a time. Now stir in the sifted ingredients from  above,
  and the walnuts.  Spread the mixture smoothly in the prepared pan. Bake
  for 20 to 25  minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle just
  barely comes
  out clean.  Let the cake cool in the pan for 15 minutes or so, then cover
  the pan  with a rack and turn the rack and pan over. Remove the pan and
  the  foil lining. Cover with a cookie sheet or a cutting board or anything
  flat and turn over again, leaving the cake right side up. While the  cake
  is cooling, start prepare triple chocolate icing.  Pour the icing, which
  may be warm or cool, over the cake. With a long,
  narrow metal spatula, spread it to cover the top. Let stand until cool
  enough to cut.  Cut into 16 squares.  From: FILE 'VITREC6.TXT' BY

      Title: Hippo Pot De Mousse
 Categories: Mousse
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 oz Semisweet chocolate
      2 oz Bittersweet chocolate
      2 c  Heavy cream,
           -well-chilled (whipping
           -cream will do nicely)
      1 t  Almond extract
           -(optional)
 
  Melt the chocolate together in the top of a double boiler.  Be careful to
  do this slowly, so as not to burn the chocolate, and to keep all moisture
  away from the pot. Let the chocolate cool for five minutes.
  
  While the chocolate cools, whip the cream and almond extract together until
  very stiff.  Gently fold the cooled chocolate into the whipped cream. There
  will be many flecks of chocolate in the mixture.
  
  If you're not going to eat it all yourself, spoon into six large wine
  glasses. Chill one hour.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Extremely quick and easy chocolate mousse -- This is an adaptation of a
  very easy chocolate mousse recipe from Sandra Boynton's hilarious book,
  "Chocolate, the Consuming Passion."  It requires none of the laborious
  preparation that most French mousse recipes call for, and really optimizes
  the effort needed to consume the chocolate, which is, after all, what this
  is all about. Yield: Serves one to six people.
  
  *  If you're careful, you can also melt the chocolate in a microwave oven,
  in its wrapper. If you try this, be especially mindful of the semisweet
  chocolate, as the sugar therein caramelizes very quickly, leading to an
  awful mess (and ruined chocolate).
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 1 hour chilling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: How To Melt Chocolate
 Categories: Information
      Yield: 1 info
 
           No ingredients
 
  TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL MELTING:
  
  Follow directions carefully.
  
  Do not overheat; these products scorch easily.
  
  Microwave directions have been tested with microwave ovens ranging
  from 500 to 700 watts (output). Times given are to be considered
  guidelines; microwave ovens differ in timing and heating patterns.
  
  Stirring frequently is important whether using rangetop directions or
  microwave directions. In the microwave oven, chocolate and other chips
  will keep their shape and may not appear melted after heating, but
  will become fluid after stirring.
  
  Handle glass microwave dishes with a hot pad after melting; the
  container may be hotter than the contents.
  
  Wash and dry the melting utensil thoroughly after each use. Any
  residue will affect the taste of the chocolate.
  
  Do not allow chocolate to come in contact with moisture during melting
  since this can cause lumping, tightening or "seizing." If this
  occurs, add one or two tablespoons shortening, such as CRISCO, for
  every six ounces chocolate; stir until fluid.
  
  Do not use butter or margarine since these may contain water. Do not
  use oil since this may prevent the mixture from setting up which is
  especially important if it is being used for a glaze.
  
  Break baking chocolate or candy bars into pieces to speed the melting
  process.

      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Butter
      2 oz Unsweetened baking c
           -hocolate squares
      1 c  Sugar
      2    Eggs
      1 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Vanilla or peppermint
           -extract
      1 c  Chocolate chips
           ------glaze------
      1 c  Powdered sugar
      1 tb Milk; or more
    1/2 ts Peppermint extract
 
  Recipe by: "C. Baden" <hazel@NETCOM.COM> Melt the butter and the
  unsweetened chocolate. (You can put them in a stainless steel bowl and
  stick it in the oven while it's preheating.)
  
  When the bowl is cool, add the sugar, beat in the eggs, mix in the flour,
  the salt, and the baking soda. Add the vanilla. Spread into a greased
  jellyroll pan (that is, 11x17). It won't be trivial; you'll have to use a
  knife or something to spread it smoothly into all four corners.
  
  Sprinkle with the chocolate chips, and bake at 350 F for 8 minutes or so.
  ("Bake until done." When they're done, they pull away from the pan just a
  little bit and have a dull glossy look to them.)
  
  Glaze: Mix up the ingredients. It should be like a glaze that will pour,
  thickly. Add a couple of drops of food coloring if desired. When the
  cookies come out of the oven, spread the glaze. Cool slightly, and cut
  while still warm. (If you wait too long, the glaze will crack when you try
  to cut the cookies.)
  
  Notes: You can skip the glaze, if you like. (For example, you might not
  want peppermint cookies, or you might want to use those miniature baking
  M&M's.) If you don't glaze them but still want peppermint chocolate
  cookies, use the peppermint instead of the vanilla. (Or in addition to it,
  for a slightly different flavor but still good.)
  
  This is Mom's recipe. It was quick and easy enough that she could make up a
  batch of cookies while getting breakfast on the table, when one of us four
  kids piped up and said "By the way, it's my turn to bring cookies today."
  
  She also has an anecdote about one of our schoolkids being allergic to
  oranges, so she made a batch with orange food coloring so he could have
  something orange anyway. You could try the same trick for Halloween
  cookies...
  
  If you don't want them to be thin bar cookies, then use a smaller pan (9x13
  or 9x9) and bake them longer.
  
  Okay, here's the "horror story" part. I got the recipe from my mom the
  other day, and decided to make them up (sans mint & glaze) that night. I'd
  been reorganizing the kitchen lately, and had a bunch of plastic canisters
  for all of my staples, but hadn't labeled everything yet.  I thought I had
  the flour.  Well, it certainly wasn't sugar, and I knew it wasn't the
  Krusteaz Deluxe Basic Cookie Mix, so it had to be the flour, so I used it.
  There was something a little odd about it - but I've got unbleached flour,
  whole wheat flour, graham flour, and cake flour, so I figured it had to be
  one of the odd ones.
  
  It wasn't.  There was something grainy and a bit of an odd flavor to the
  cookies.  Can you say "Masa Harina"?  I'd used corn instead of wheat flour!
  
  My next door neighbor Selene, and my SO's daughter Maria, and her little
  friend Devin like them, but nobody else will eat them.
  
  I tried the recipe again tonight.  I made the plain batch, no mint or mint
  glaze, and used mini-M&M's instead of the chocolate chips.  I've tried them
  ~ they're perfect in every way - and if I just imagine them with
  peppermint, they're exactly as I remember them.
  
  A final footnote: I am quite serious about working to spread them all the
  way to the corners.  It'll be a thick batter, so just keep at it; it'll
  make a thin layer.  That's a good thing, because it means they cook fast,
  so don't give up.
  
  [P.S. At least that's how they turn out (thick and hard to spread into the
  corners) when I make them, using the mixer.  Your mileage may vary,
  especially if you're using margarine.

      Yield: 10 servings
 
           -----cheesecake-----:
      1 lb Cream cheese; softened
      1 lb Granulated sugar

      3 oz Good-quality milk chocolate
      3 tb Sweet butter
    1/4 c  Ground hazelnuts
    1/4 c  Crushed cornflakes
 
  Recipe by: Felicia Pickering <MNHAN063@SIVM.SI.EDU> To prepare the
  cheesecake mixture:  In a large mixing bowl with a paddle attachment cream
  together the cream cheese, sugar, and sour cream, scraping down the sides
  of the bowl often.  In a medium-size bowl combine the eggs and Kahlua,
  whisking them together.  Once the cream cheese mixture is softened and lump
  free, add the eggs in 3 parts, scraping down the sides of the bowl after
  each addition.  In another medium-size bowl place the melted milk
  chocolate, then slowly whisk in a little of the cheesecake mixture,
  whisking constantly to create a smooth mixture. Add the milk chocolate
  mixture back into the cheesecake mixture and stir until completely blended.
  To bake the cheesecake:  Preheat the oven to 300 F.  Butter a round
  springform pan.  Pour the mixture into the teflon pan and place in a water
  bath (a pan holding the cheesecake pan, filled halfway with water). Bake
  the cheesecake until the center is solid, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove from
  the water bath and let the cake cool completely. Then chill in the
  refrigerator.
  
  To prepare the hazelnut crust:  In a double boiler melt the milk chocolate
  and butter and stir until completely dissolved.  Remove from the heat, and
  fold in the hazelnuts and cornflakes.  Take the cheesecake out of the
  refrigerator and pour the milk chocolate crust on top. Place back in the
  refrigerator and allow to set overnight. To serve: When ready to serve,
  remove the cheesecake from the refrigerator and take it out of the
  springform pan.  Invert the cake onto a large serving plate so the crust is
  on the bottom and serve

  Make the chocolate cookie wafers: Position a rack in the lower third of the
  oven and preheat to 275 F. Generously butter two large baking sheets. Cut a
  3 1/2 inch circle out from plastic coffee can or similar lid. Discard the
  center. The outer rim of the lid will be used as a stencil for the wafers.
  Into a large stainless steel bowl, sift together the flour, the cocoa, and
  the black pepper. In a 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer
  fitted with the wire whip attachment, on medium speed, beat the
  confectioners' sugar and the egg whit until well combined. Continue beating
  on medium-high speed until glossy and stiff peaks form, about 5 to 6
  minutes. With a large rubber spatula, fold 1 of the flour mixture into the
  stiff egg white/sugar mixture. Fold in the vanilla and half of the melted
  butter. Fold in another third of the flour mixture. Fold in the rest of the
  melted butter and the flour mixture.
   Place the prepared wafer stencil on the baking sheet. Fill the stencil wit
  spatula. Repeat this process with the remaining batter. Bake the wafers for
  pliable when they come out of the oven, but will become crisp as they cool.
  Carefully remove the individual wafers to a cooling rack to finish cooling.

  pretty marbled effect. Bake at 450*F for 10 minutes WITHOUT opening oven

      Yield: 1 Batch
 
     50    Cotton balls, plain
           OR
           Cotton wool, 3 by 6 feet
      2 lb Bittersweet chocolate
    1/2 c  Liqueur, any favorite
           -[optional]
 
  If starting from cotton wool, divide it into about 50 pieces, making sure
  they are well formed, round, and the rough edges have been worked back into
  the mass to make a smooth surface.
  
  Melt the chocolate in a double boiler being careful not to get any water in
  the chocolate.
  
  In batches of about ten put the balls of cotton on a fine rack or grate.
  Sprinkle with the liqueur if you're using it.  [Be careful! Too much will
  overpower the other flavors.]
  
  Slowly pour enough chocolate over each ball of cotton to coat it
  thoroughly, letting excess drip off. Allow the chocolate coating to cool
  before taking the chocolate covered cotton from the rack.
  
  Keep stored in a closed container in a cool place away from light.
  Munitions boxes work well for this.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chocolate covered cotton -- This is a recipe I invented after I had
  cornered the cotton market and couldn't get rid of the stuff.
  
  While good orlon can be substituted for the cotton, the resulting product
  won't have the same flavor or texture as the real thing. Your friends will
  be able to tell that you've been skimping. Egyptian cotton works best.
  Yield: About fifty servings.
  
  *  As a special cold-weather treat, use wool instead of cotton.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  2 hours.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: Mint White Chocolate Mousse
 Categories: Mousse
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 oz Chocolate, white
      3 T  Creme de menthe, green
      1 c  Cream, heavy
      2    Egg whites
           -(at room temperature)
 
  Melt the white chocolate in a double boiler.  When melted, stir in the
  creme de menthe. Let it cool a bit and stir in about 2 1/2 T of cream. Let
  cool.
  
  Beat the egg whites until stiff, but not dry.  Fold the
  chocolate-creme-cream mixture into the beaten egg whites. THE MORE
  CAREFULLY YOU FOLD, THE LIGHTER WILL BE THE MOUSSE.
  
  Whip the remaining cream, until soft peaks form.  Fold the egg
  whites-chocolate mixture into the whipped cream.  AGAIN, THE MORE AIR YOU
  PRESERVE, THE LIGHTER THE MOUSSE.  Spoon carefully into small bowls or cups
  and chill for about two hours.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Sinful and light mint chocolate mousse -- This concoction is a variation
  of another white chocolate mousse, which is a variation of a dark rum
  chocolate mousse. It was invented for a friend's birthday, which happens to
  be on St. Patrick's Day. We were sitting around the day before, planning
  the celebration, and I offered to bring some white mousse. Someone
  suggested it should be green, in honor of the occasion. I came up with the
  perfect way to make green chocolate mousse....

      Title: My Mom's Extraordinary Chocolate Chip Cake
 Categories: Chocolate, Cake
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 c  All-purpose flour; u
           -nbleached
      2 c  Light brown sugar; packed
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
      1    Unsalted butter; cut in 6
           -pieces
      1 lg Egg
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 c  Sour cream
      2 tb Optional
      9 oz Semisweet chocolate chips
 
  Recipe by: sandyg@sequent.com (Sandy Gifford) 1. Position oven rack in the
  middle of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F. Butter a 11x7x1 3/4-inch
  baking pan or ovenproof glass baking dish.
  
  2. Put the flour, brown sugar and cinnamon in a large bowl and mix with an
  electric mixer on low speed for 15 seconds. Add the butter and mix till the
  butter pieces are the size of peas. You will still see loose flour. Mix in
  the egg.  The mixture will still look dry. Rub any lumps out of the baking
  soda and gently mix the baking soda into the sour cream. Stir the sour
  cream mixture and the milk into the batter. Stir just until the batter is
  evenly moistened.  Stir in the chocolate chips. The batter will be thick.
  
  3.  Spread the batter in the prepared baking pan.  Bake about 40 minutes.
  To test for doneness, gently press your fingers on the top of the cake. The
  middle should feel slightly soft and the edges firm. A toothpick in the
  center should have a few crumbs clinging to it. Cool on a wire baking rack,
  the center of the cake will sink slightly.
  
  Notes:  My metal cake pan is the size specified, like a small lasagna pan.
  The cake took 47 minutes to bake.
  
  The 2 Tb. milk is optional, I find the cake is better with it.
  
  This cake is good dusted with powdered sugar and is also good served with
  vanilla ice cream.

  NOTES:
  
  *  A Favorite Canadian sweet -- This comes from a page in an obscure
  magazine called something like "Canadian Homemaker_, by way of a Canadian
  friend, Steve Deering. This is a traditional Canadian sweet, much loved and
  admired. The origin of the recipe seems to be lost in the mists of time,
  though everyone seems to agree that it comes from the town of Nanaimo, in
  British Columbia.

      Yield: 20 Bars
 
-----------------------------------CRUST-----------------------------------
    1/2 c  Butter
    1/4 c  Sugar, granulated
      5 T  Cocoa
      1    Egg
      1 t  Vanilla
  1 2/3 c  Graham wafer crumbs, fine
      1 c  Coconut, desiccated

    1/4 c  Butter
      2 c  Icing sugar, sifted
      1    Egg

-----------------------------CHOCOLATE TOPPING-----------------------------
      4 oz Chocolate, semi-sweet
      1 T  Butter
 
  MAKE CRUST:  Grease a 9-inch square cake pan.  In a sauce pan combine the
  butter, sugar, cocoa, egg and vanilla.  Cook over medium heat stirring
  constantly, until smooth and slightly thickened.  Stir in the remaining
  crust ingredients and press into prepared pan.
  
  Make the creamy center:  cream the butter and gradually beat in icing sugar
  and egg.  Spread over crumb mixture and chill for about 15 minutes.
  
  Make the chocolate topping:  melt the chocolate and butter together over
  hot water or in a microwave, being careful not to burn. Spread on top of
  the previous parts. Chill until set. Cut into squares with a sharp knife.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  No-bake, 3-layer (chocolate covered) bars -- Nanaimo bars are a
  traditional Canadian dessert, though nobody is certain where the tradition
  came from. Laura Secord is a Canadian candy company; their cook book says
  this about the origin of these fattening delicacies:
  
  "A version of these no-bake bars developed in the Canadian kitchens of a
  well-known food company, was christened by them Nanaimo bars after the city
  of that name on Vancouver Island. Nanaimo (from sne-ny-mo, a local Indian
  term for a loose confederation of five bands) started as a Hudson Bay
  Trading Post in 1849."
  
  : Difficulty:  Easy.
  : Time:  1 hour preparation, several hours chilling.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

  Combine cocoa, sugar and salt.  Add milk.  Bring to a boil, stirring cons

  fudge.
  (So does stirring before it cools to luke warm.) Immersed pan in cold
  water: don't stir until candy is only luke warm. If you have a marble
  slab, this is easier. Pour out onto Marble slab: Let stand until lukewarm.
   (OK to pour vanilla, etc. right on). Work back & forth until it starts to
  set up. Form into a long roll; slice and wrap tightly sealed.

      Title: Old Fashioned Creamy Fudge
 Categories: Candy, Comments
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 c  Sugar
    3/4 c  Milk
  2 1/2 oz Hershey's® baking chocolate
      2 tb Light corn syrup
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 tb Butter
      1 ts Vanilla
 
  Recipe by: Hershey's Cocoa pkg
  Combine sugar, milk, baking chocolate, corn syrup and salt in a
  heavy 2-quart saucepan.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly,
  unti mixture boils.  Cook, stirring occasionally, to 234 degrees F
  (or until small amount dropped into cold water forms a soft ball).
  
   Remove from heat; add butter and vanilla.  Do NOT stir.  Allow fudge
  to cool at room termperature without stirring until it reaches
  110 degrees F.  Beat until fudge thickens and loses some of its gloss.
   Quickly pour fudge into a lightly buttered 8-inch square pan.  About
  1-1/2 pounds fudge.
  
   I checked a 1930 edition of the "Hershey Recipe Book" for fudge
  recipes.
   It contains these recipes:  Angel Fudge; Country Club Two Story Fudge;
  Chocolate College Fudge; Chocolate Gelatine Fudge; Condensed Milk
  Chocolate Syrup Fudge; Whipped Cream Fudge; Molasses Fudge; Cocoa
  Fudge
  (different from the one posted above); Sour Cream Fudge.  The fudge
  recipe I used to use from the Hershey's package contained
  the light corn syrup, so I suppose what I've posted might be what
  you're
  looking for.  But if any of the others are of interest, I'll be happy
  to post them.

  *  I've just recently found Oreo Cookie crumbs in a box. A great time saver
  for the lazy.
  
  Heat oven to 325 F.
  
  Mix crumbs, cinnamon, and butter. Press onto bottom of 9-inch springform
  pan.
  
  Bake 10 minutes.
  
  Increase oven temperature to 350 F.
  
  Beat cream cheese and sugar at medium speed with electric mixer until well
  blended. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Blend
  in sour cream and vanilla.
  
  Separate batter into 2 equal parts. Blend chocolate into one part. Blend
  liqueur and peel into remaining part. Pour chocolate batter over crust.
  Bake 30 minutes.
  
  Reduce oven temperatue to 325 F.
  
  Spoon remaining batter over chocolate layer. Continue baking another 30
  minutes. Turn off oven and prop open oven door; remove cheesecake when oven
  has cooled. Loosen cake from rim of pan.
  
  I think cheesecake in general is best when chilled over night, but it is
  not necessary.

      Title: Other Helpful Hints
 Categories: Information
      Yield: 1 info
 
           No ingredients
 
  INGREDIENTS: Use butter or regular margarine in sticks. Do not use
  butter or margarine produced in tubs or squeeze bottles in baking. Do
  not use margarine type of products labeled "spread." They will not
  perform in the same way as butter or margarine and are not generally
  substitutable.
  
  Use all-purpose flour that has not been sifted in these recipes. If
  an old recipe calls for sifted flour, remove two tablespoons flour
  per cup instead of sifting.
  
  BAKING: Preheat oven for 5 minutes before baking.
  
  Place baking pans or cookie sheets in the center of the oven for best
  air circulation. This will help to avoid hot spots in the oven which
  could cause burning.
  
  EQUIPMENT: Hershey Kitchens' baking recipes are developed with shiny
  metal baking pans (pies are in glass pie plates). If you use dark
  metal baking pans, your baking time may be slightly less. If you use
  insulated bakeware, your baking time may be slightly longer. If you
  use glass baking dishes, lower your oven temperature 25'F.

 Categories: Chocolate, Dessert
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           -Chocolate Mousse
 
  5 Tablespoons unsalted butter
  1.1/2 ounces imported semi-sweet chocolate
  1/2 cup unsweetened Dutch process cocoa
  2 egg yolks
  1/4 cup sugar
  2 Tablespoons strong brewed coffee
  2 Tablespoons water
  1/2 cup heavy cream, whipped until firm
  
  Chocolate Squares:
  
  2.1/2 ounces semisweet chocolate - 1 part sweetened, 1 part
  unsweetened
  
  Sauce:
  
  1/2 cup cream
  2 egg yolks
  1/2 pound white chocolate
  2 ounces sugar
  2 Tablespoons Cream of Cocoa liqueur
  
  To prepare chocolate mousse, in a double boiler, combine butter,
  chocolate and cocoa; heat until thoroughly melted. Mix well to
  combine.
  
  Meanwhile with an electric mixer, beat egg yolks and sugar until
  pale and thick. Beat in coffee and water, then beat in hot
  chocolate mixture. Turn the mixer on high speed and beat in
  whipped cream. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
  
  To prepare chocolate squares, in a double boiler, melt 2.1/2
  ounces chocolate. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.
  Place a sheet of parchment paper on a cookie tray and weight down
  ends of paper securely. With a pencil and ruler, draw an 8 x 10
  inch rectangle.
  Pour melted chocolate into center of rectangle and use a spatula
  to spread it as evenly as possible, following the outline you
  have drawn. Set aside in a cool place to harden; do not
  refrigerate. When chocolate is nearly firm, use a sharp knife to
  score 12 rectangles of equal size. Let chocolate harden
  completely.
  To make sauce, bring 1/2 cup cream to a boil. Melt 1/2 pound
  white chocolate into the cream. Whip 2 egg yolks and 2 ounces of
  sugar until white and fold the mixture into the cream. The cream
  should not be boiling when you add the eggs. Stir in the cream of
  cocoa liqueur.
  Spoon a pool of sauce onto each serving plate.
  Carefully peel parchment paper from chocolate rectangles and
  place one rectangle in the middle of each sauce pool.
  Add a dollop of chocolate mousse in the centers. Top each with
  another chocolate rectangle.
  Garnish with mint leaves, fresh raspberries and whipped cream, if
  desired.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

      Title: Passover Chocolate Nut Torte
 Categories: Jewish, Dessert
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
-----------------------------------TORTE-----------------------------------
      6 oz Butter (or margarine)
    3/4 c  Sugar
      7    Eggs, separated
      4 oz Chocolate (bittersweet),
           -melted and cooled
      1 c  Almonds (unblanched),
           -finely ground
    1/2 t  Baking powder
    1/4 c  Almonds (unblanched),
           -chopped

-----------------------------------ICING-----------------------------------
      4    Eggs, lightly beaten
    1/2 t  Potato starch
      4 oz Chocolate (bittersweet),
           -melted
      4 oz Margarine, softened
    1/2 c  Almonds, finely ground
 
  TO MAKE TORTE:  Cream the butter and gradually beat in the sugar until the
  mixture is light and creamy.  Beat in the yolks, one at a time. Blend in
  the chocolate, and gently fold in the ground almonds mixed with the baking
  powder. Beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry, then fold into the
  mixture.
  
  Pour into a well-greased 10-inch springform pan.  Bake about 30 minutes in
  an oven preheated to 350 degrees F. degrees. Allow to cool, then frost
  thickly with the icing and sprinkle with the chopped nuts.
  
  TO MAKE ICING:  Mix together the eggs, sugar and potato starch in the top
  of a double boiler. Heat over boiling water, stirring, until mixture
  thickens.
   Do not boil the mixture, and beware of "scrambled eggs!" Cool, then stir
  in the chocolate.
  
  Gradually beat in the butter, one tablespoon at a time.  Fold in the nuts
  until the mixture is thick enough to spread.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Rich chocolate dessert for Passover.  This is the only Passover dessert
  I've ever tasted that is good enough to be making during the rest of the
  year as well (when you can use corn starch instead of the potato starch).
  
  *  If you don't have a springform pan for Passover, use an aluminum
  disposable cake pan and just strip off the sides when the cake has cooled.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 30 minutes baking, 5 minutes frosting.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

  here is my all time favorite pie, it is rich but sooo fabulous
  
  Ann's chocolate pie
  6 oz choc chips              1 tea lemon juice
  1/4 cup cornstarch           1 cup whipping cream

  1/4 cup (again) water        2 cups flour
  1   eggwhite
  1 tea vanilla
  
  (can be made in a pie shell but I have best results in a spring release
  pan)
  First prepare crust,Mix butter and 4 tbl of sugar together and add flour ,
  mix
  until crumbly (about 3 mins on med) pat 2/3 of mixture into pie pan or
  spring
  pan and put remainder into a small pan and heat both at 350 for about
  15mins
  (or until light brown)  stir the small pan amount once during cooking time
  to
  create crumbs
  Once done put in refrigerater to cool completely
  
  Melt choc in cornsyrup and 1/4 cup of water ( Can be done over low heat or
  in
  the microwave 4mins on med) stir to incorporate and put in refrigerater to
  cool completely
  
  Combine 1/2 c of sugar, 1/4 c water, egg white, vanilla  and lemon juice ,
  beat on high speed until peeks form (this takes a long time about 20
  minutes
  with my mixer).  In a seperate bowl beat one cup of whipping cream until
  thick. Fold cream and half of the chocolate mixture into the eggwhite mix.
  Spoon into shell. Drizzle other half of the chocolate over filling and cut

     36    Reese's peanut butter cups
      1 lb Refrigerated cookie dough
 
  * - (Either fudge, sugar, or peanut butter dough)
  
  Refrigerate candies so paper will peel off easily. Unwrap each.
  Follow slicing instructions on cookie wrapper and quarter each
  slice. Place each piece in a greased miniature muffin cup. Place
  in preheated 350ø oven for 8-10 minutes or just until cookie puffs
  and is barely done. Remove from oven and immediately push a candy
  cup into each cookie filled muffin cup. The cookie will deflate and
  form a tart shell around the peanut butter cup. The heat from the
  cookie will melt the chocolate toppings. Let the pan cool; then
  refrigerate until shine leaves the chocolate. Remove from the
  refrigerator and gently lift each tart from the cup with the tip
  of a knife. Makes 36 cookies. UUMMMHHH !

      Title: Perfect Sweet Tart and Tartlet Crust
 Categories: Appetizers, Dessert, Pie
      Yield: 1 servings
 
     14 T  Butter; unsalted (1 3/4
           -sticks)
  2 1/3 c  Flour
           Pinch salt
      3 T  Sugar
      2    Egg yolks beaten =WITH=
      4 T  Ice water - to 5 T
 
  In the food processor, cut the butter into the flour.  Add the salt
  and sugar.  Do not overwork.  Little by little add the egg yolks and
  water. Process 15 to 20 seconds.  Turn p[astry onto a floured board,
  and blend the pastry by pressing it into a ball and then kneading it
  quickly with the heel of your hand until no lumps remain.  As with
  all pastry, work as quickly as possible, and use as little additional
  flour as possible to avoid toughening the dough.
  
  Chill dough at least 20 minutes.
  
  After chilling, roll 1/8 inch thick and cut into shapes slightly
  larger than the tart or tartlet pans.  Press pastry into the tartlet
  (or tart) pans and cut off excess with your thumb.  Chill in pans
  before baking. Any unused pastry can be tightly wrapped and chilled
  or frozen for future use.
  
  To bake:  Use foil and weight down with beans or use other tart tins
  to line the tart. Preheat oven to 375^.  Bake the shells for 15 to 17
  (??) minutes. When they seem to be coloring slightly around the
  edges, remove the top pans and return pastry to oven to dry out.  Do
  not brown.  Cool the shells on racks.  If not to be used immediately,
  store in a tightly covered plastic container in the freezer.
  
  Thaw before using.
  
  Makes one 10-inch tart; two 9-inch tarts; or twelve 3-inch tartlets.
  Can also use small muffin tins for appetizers. It's about the right
  size for the Chocolate Victoria's.
  
  Note:  Watch that you don't add too much water, particularly if not
         made with a food processor.

    1/4 c  Sweet pesach wine
    1/2 c  Apricot jam

    1/3 c  Water
      3 tb Vegetable oil

      1 oz Chocolate; for curls
 
  Recipe by: Net Grease a 9 inch springform pan well and coat it with potato
  starch or sugar tapping out excess.
  
   For the batter, in a large mixing bowl, beat the 5 egg whites with the sal
  and lemon juice until foamy.  Very gradually add 1/4 cup sugar and continu
  beating the whites until they form stiff, but not dry, peaks.
  
   Use the same beaters and another bowl to beat the 5 egg yolks and addition
  egg with the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and lemon rind until very light and
  fluffy.  Gently but thouroughly fold the beaten whites into yolks.  Fold i
  chocolate and nuts, and pour batter into pan.
  
   Bake torte in a preheated 325 degree oven for 50-55 minutes or until top
  springs back when gently pressed.
  
   [this will not rise as much as you think it ought.  Don't worry about it]
  
   Leave the torte in the oven, turn off the heat, and open the door slightly
  After 10 minutes remove torte from oven.  Run a knife around the edge of t
  torte to release it from the pan rim.  Cool it for another 30 minutes in t
  pan.  Remove the pan rim and cool the torte completely on the bottom.
  
   [This next part is for icing the Torte.  What I've done in the past is mak
  layers, following the above directions, doubled the amount of raspberry sy
  and dribbled half over each torte as per the directions and skipped the ja
  I've then used the chocolate glaze as an icing for between the layers, and

   Cover a 9 or 10 inch cardboard circle with heavy duty aluminum foil or fre
  paper or use a cake plate.  Invert torte onto base and remove pan bottom.
   Sprinkle wine [or whatever] evenly over torte.  Heat jam until thinned; th
  bruch or spread it all over the torte.  (this adds flavor and smooths the
  surface).
  
   For the glaze, combine the water, oil, sugar, and cocoa in a small suacepa
  and mix very well.  Cook the mixture over low heat, stirring constantly, f
  10-14 minutes, or until the glaze thickens slightly and is very smooth and
  shiney.  For the best flavor and texture it should not boil.  Remove glaze
  from heat and stir 3-4 minutes longer until it cools slightly and gets a b
  thicker.  Pour all the glaze in the center of the torte and immediately us
  metal or rubber spatula to evenly spread it all over top and sides.  Wipe
  any drips from base.
  
   Let torte rest a few minutes until the glaze begins to set, but is still s
  Press handfulls of ground nuts all over the sides, but not the top.  Arran
  whole nuts, evenly spaced in circle on top about 1 inch from edge.  Heap
  chocolate curls or bits in center.
  
   Refrigerate the uncovered, completed torte for several hours or, preferabl
  overnight so the glaze will set and the flavors and textures will "mellow"
  
   (Once the glaze has set, the torte can be frozen for up to 3 weeks.  Freez
  uncovered, then wrap it in plastic wrap or tin foil.  Unwrap it before tha
  and thaw for several hours in the refrigerator.

      Title: Prinzregent Torte
 Categories: Austrian, Cake
      Yield: 1 Cake
 
------------------------------------CAKE------------------------------------
      9 oz Butter, salted
      9 oz Sugar
    1/8 t  Vanilla extract
      4 lg Eggs, beaten
  1 2/3 c  Cake flour, about
           -(sift before measuring!!)
    1/2 c  Cornstarch
      1 t  Baking powder

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      2 c  Chocolate pudding
           -(extra strong)
      7 oz Butter, unsalted
  1 2/3 c  Powdered 10X sugar

----------------------------------FROSTING----------------------------------
      1 oz Cocoa powder, bitter
      1 oz Butter (sweet), melted
      3 T  Water, boiling
           -(up to 4 T)
 
  In an electric mixer, whip the salted butter.  Add sugar, vanilla and eggs.
  Beat smooth.  Mix flour with cornstarch and baking powder and sift a second
  time (you sift it once before you measured it, right?). Add flour mixture
  to egg mixture, stirring constantly.
  
  Make 8 layers, each less than about 1/4 inch thick, by baking each in the
  bottom of an 8-inch springform layer pan.  Do this by cutting a round of
  baker's parchment that exactly fits the bottom of the layer pan, then using
  a spatula to spread the dough evenly over the parchment. Make sure that it
  doesn't get too thin at the edges. Bake each layer for 7 minutes in a
  preheated 400 degree F. oven.  Stack the layers separated by waxed paper.
  
  MAKE THE PUDDING:  Use more chocolate in the pudding than you would
  normally use. If you want to be lazy and use pudding from a mix, then add
  about a tablespoon of top-quality cocoa to the pudding mix. Stir the
  pudding while it cools so that it does not congeal. Beat the unsalted
  butter until it is very smooth. When the butter and pudding are about the
  same temperature, add the pudding to the butter to get an even, smooth
  buttercream.
  
  Use the pudding/butter mixture as mortar, and layer the cake together,
  spreading the pudding/butter evenly between the layers.  Make sure the
  layers are even and parallel; if they are not, or if one is not straight,
  you can mend things with a little extra pudding here and there. Do not put
  pudding on top of the topmost layer, and try not to get too much on the
  outside edges.
  
  MAKE A CHOCOLATE FROSTING:  Sift the powdered 10X sugar and cocoa together,
  add the melted butter while stirring constantly, then add boiling water.
  Frost the cake, taking pains to make sure the sides are perfectly smooth
  and the top is perfectly smooth. Let the cake sit at cool room temperature
  for at least an hour before serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Austrian 8-layer chocolate cake -- I made this recipe for my boyfriend
  on his birthday and he asked me to marry him (I did). I'm not saying for
  sure that the Prinzregent Torte is why Don wanted to marry me, but I've
  always worried that it might have been. It is a magnificent recipe that
  always evokes incredulous cries of pleasure from people that I serve it to.
  The cake is a lot of work, so I only make it about once a year, but the
  people that I make it for feel very special. Yield: Serves 2-8.
  
  *  If you are not an experienced baker, you should be warned that in
  recipes like this it is important to measure exactly and to follow the
  instructions exactly. People who prefer to cook by testing, tasting, and
  adding more ingredients should avoid intricate baking.
  
  *  These layers are baked in the bottom of a springform pan.  Such a pan
  bottom is about 8 inches in diameter, and has a raised lip that is about
  1/8 inch high. It resembles a miniature pizza pan. I have never succeeded
  in making this torte with layers bigger than about 10 inches; about 8
  inches is easier. The baker's parchment is crucial and there is no good
  substitute, though buttered kraft paper (from shopping bags) will work in a
  pinch. Use a new piece of parchment for each layer. If you don't make the
  layers straight, then when you pile them up, the cake will be mounded up in
  the middle or will sag down in the middle or will tilt to one side.
  
  *  If you are not an experienced cake froster, then make double the recipe
  of frosting. Unskilled frosters usually use too much frosting, and you
  don't really want to run out. You can charge money to people who want to
  lick the spoon if there is any left over.
  
  Difficulty:  rather difficult;  Time:  1 hour;  Precision:  measure
  carefully.

 Categories: Microwave, Sauces, Chicken
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 md Onion, chopped
           -(or 1/2 large onion)
      1    Garlic clove, minced
      2 T  Butter
      1    Bay leaf
      6    Peppercorns
      3    Cloves (whole), crushed
      8 oz Tomato sauce
      1 c  Chicken broth
      1 sl Bread, shredded
    1/4 t  Anise seeds, crushed
    1/2 t  Cinnamon
      1 T  Sugar
      4 T  Chile, ground
           -(approximately; see note)
      2 T  Sesame seeds
    1/2 c  Almonds (blanched),
           -slivered
  1 1/2 oz Mexican chocolate,
           -grated (a half circle
           -in the usual packaging)
      1    Chicken, cut up
           -(about 3 pounds)
 
  Put the onion, garlic and margarine in a large (3-quart) microwaveable,
  covered casserole.  Cover and microwave on half power for 2-3 minutes, or
  until butter is melted and the onion is starting to soften.
  
  Mix in the rest of the ingredients except the chocolate and the chicken.
  Cover and microwave on high for 10 minutes, stirring after half the time.
  When the sauce is done, stir in the chocolate until it's melted.
  
  Add the chicken, coating each piece with sauce.  Microwave covered, on high
  power for about 30 minutes.  Rearrange the pieces twice during cooking so
  it cooks evenly. The chicken is done when it starts to fall away from the
  bone.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A microwave version of Mole Poblano -- Mole Poblano (pronounced MOE-lay
  puh-BLAH-no) is the kind of Mexican cooking one doesn't often find in
  restaurants outside of Mexico.  It consists of chicken in a dark, spicy
  sauce full of nuts and sesame seeds. All of the traditional mole recipes
  I've seen require several hours of preparation and cooking time, so I
  developed this version for those of us who have only limited time for
  cooking.  It takes about an hour to put together.
  
  *  My microwave puts out 650 watts on high power and has a turntable in it.
  You'll probably have to stir things more often if yours doesn't have a
  turntable.  If your microwave is rated at less than 600 watts, it's
  probably too small to fit the chicken in anyway.
  
  *  Use pure ground chile, not chile powder (which usually contains other
  ingredients).  The stuff I use comes in little plastic bags, and they keep
  it in the Mexican food section of the store instead of the spice section.
  The hotness of the chile can vary considerably, so the most reliable
  procedure is to mix in a little at a time, tasting the sauce as you go
  along.  Mole is supposed to be spicy, not scorchingly hot; a blend of mild
  chiles gives the best flavor. I usually use about 2 T mild Pasilla chile
  and another about 2 tablespoons medium-hot California chile.
  
  *  Mexican chocolate comes in round tablets about 3 inches in diameter. If
  you can't find any in the grocery store, use a piece of a dark chocolate
  candy bar (or semi-sweet chocolate chips) instead, and add an additional
      1/2 t  cinnamon.
  
  *  You can substitute pine nuts, toasted pumpkin seeds, or raisins for all
  or part of the almonds.
  
  *  In theory, you can cook this on top of the stove in a Dutch oven in the
  traditional style, although I've never tried it myself. Judging by the
  recipes I've seen, you should simmer the chicken in water for about an hour
  first, then make the sauce and cook the chicken in the sauce for another
  half hour.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

           Nuts
 
  Sift the dry ingredients together in a mixing bowl.  Soften the butter and
  add with the milk and vanilla to dry ingredients. Beat for 2 mins with a
  wooden spoon or until smooth. Add eggs and beat another 2 mins. Pour into
  an 8-inch round cake tin (I find the collapsible type best). Cook in a
  moderate 350-375 degree F. oven for 1 hour.
  
  Turn the cooled cake over, slice into two layers and fill with cream. Melt
  chocolate with copha (do not burn) and pour over cake, dribbling it down
  the side. Decorate with almonds, pecans or walnuts.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Dangerously delicious chocolate cake.
  
  *  Self-raising flour is popular in Britain and Australia, and hard to find
  in North America. Substitute about 2 cups of ordinary flour, all-purpose
  with about 1/2 t of salt and about 3 t of baking powder mixed in.
  
  *  The North American equivalent of caster sugar is "granulated sugar."
  There is no equivalent of copha, but a mixture of butter and coconut is
  better than nothing. Crisco has the right cooking properties to substitute
  for copha, but the wrong flavor.
  
  *  You can pour a little Grand Marnier into the cake before spreading the
  cream in the middle, but it doesn't need it.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking, 1 hour to cool and 5
  minutes decorating. 5 minutes to eat.
  : Precision:  Measure the ingredients, though the cocoa and cream are not
  critical.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
           -----raspberry sauce-----
      2 c  Fresh raspberries; or
           -thawed frozen
    1/3 c  Superfine sugar; (in
           -stant-dissolving)
    1/4 c  Chambord raspberry liqueur
      1 ts Lemon juice
           -----assembly-----
      1 c  Heavy cream
      1 tb Granulated sugar
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
      2 pt Raspberry sorbet and
           -vanilla ice cream -- * see
      1 pt Chocolate ice cream
    1/2 c  Chocolate syrup
     24    Amaretti cookies
    1/4 c  Chambord
    1/2 pt Fresh raspberries
 
  Recipe by: webmaster@godiva.com * such as Haagen Dazs Raspberry Sorbet and
  Cream.
  
  Make the raspberry sauce:
  
   1. In a food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade, combine the
  raspberries, sugar, Chambord, and lemon juice. Process the mixture for 30
  to 45 seconds, or until smooth. Strain the pure through a fine-meshed
  sieve into a small bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at
  least 1 hour, until chilled.
  
  Assemble the sundaes:
  
   1. In a chilled 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, using the
  wire whip attachment, beat the cream, sugar, and vanilla at medium-high
  speed until slightly stiff peaks begin to form.
   Transfer the cream to a pastry bag fitted with a star tip (such as Ateco
  #7) and refrigerate the cream until ready to use.
  
   2. Spoon about l 1/2 tablespoons of the raspberry sauce into the bottom of
  a large sundae glass. Add 4 or 5 raspberries. Coarsely crumble 2 amaretti
  cookies over the berries and drizzle with 1 teaspoon Chambord. Place a
  small scoop of the raspberry sorbet and vanilla ice cream on top of the
  cookie layer. Drizzle about 1 1/2 tablespoons of the chocolate syrup over
  the scoop. Top with a scoop of chocolate ice cream and a drizzle of
  raspberry sauce and 4 or 5 raspberries. Coarsely crumble 2 more amaretti
  cookies over the berries and drizzle with 1 teaspoon Chambord. Top with a
  scoop of raspberry sorbet and vanilla ice cream. Drizzle with some of the
  raspberry sauce. Pipe a large rosette of whipped cream on top of the sundae
  and garnish with fresh raspberries and an amaretti cookie. Repeat this
  procedure to make 4 sundaes. Serve immediately.

  1 1/4 c  Vanilla wafer crumbs;
           -(about 40 wafers)
    1/4 c  Cocoa powder
    1/4 c  Powdered sugar
    1/4 c  Unsalted butter; melted

     24 oz Cream cheese; softened

      Title: Raspberry Sauce
 Categories: Chocolate, Sauces
      Yield: 1 cup
 
 
     1   pt raspberries; fresh
    2    T  water
   1/4   c  sugar
    2    T  corn syrup; light
  
  Notes:  This is the most luxurious of all fruit sauces, for here we cheat
  nature by removing the thorns on the rose of the fruit world- the seeds of
  the raspberry.  Most raspberry sauces depend so much on sugar and
  thickening agents to achieve proper texture that they dull the fruit's
  naturally sharp flavor.  Here the sauce is thickened with the pulp of the
  berries themselves, creating a fruity, velvety, gleaming sauce worth
  making for the scent in your kitchen alone! Remember all fresh raspberries
  are not created equal; you may need to reduce the sauce more or less
  depending on their moisture content.
  
  1. Put raspberries and water in saucepan and bring to a boil over medium
  heat.  Use wooden spoon to stir in sugar, and cook for 5 minutes, till
  berries are completely broken down.
  
  2. Pour berries into strainer over small bowl; allow to cool.  Then press
  through as much of the remaining juice and pulp as possible, till nothing
  remains in strainer but dry seeds.  You may use a spoon or rubber spatula
  for this, but your best tool here is your fingers, rubbing the pulp up the
  sides of the strainer.  Occasionally scrape the accumulation on the
  underside into the juice.  You may need to repeat this to remove all the
  seeds; if you do, whisk strained raspberries first.
  
  3. Whisk the pulp and juice together with the corn syrup, and return to
  saucepan.  Cook over medium heat another 10 minutes to clear sauce and
  reduce it to 1 cup.  Put in storage container and refrigerate. Serve cold.
  
  About keeping:  Will last up to 2 weeks, refrigerated, but if reboiled
  weekly will last several weeks longer.

      Title: Rigo Jancsi, Part 1 of 2
 Categories: Dessert, Hungarian
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
------------------------------------CAKE------------------------------------
      2 T  Butter
           Flour or cocoa
      3 oz Chocolate, unsweetened
    3/4 c  Butter (unsalted),
           -softened
    1/2 c  Sugar
      4    Eggs, separated
      1 pn Salt
    1/2 c  Flour, all-purpose
           -(sifted)

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
     10 oz Chocolate (semisweet),
           -chopped or broken
           -into small chunks
  1 1/2 c  Heavy cream
      4 T  Dark rum
      1 t  Vanilla extract

-----------------------------------GLAZE-----------------------------------
      7 oz Chocolate (semisweet),
           -broken or chopped
           -into small chunks
      1 c  Sugar, granulated (fine)
    1/3 c  Water
 
  TO MAKE CAKE:   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  With a pastry brush or
  paper towel, coat an 11x17 inch jelly-roll pan with the butter. This will
  seem like a lot; be very generous.  Sprinkle the flour or cocoa over the
  butter and shake the pan to coat the butter fully. Tap the edge of the pan
  on a table to knock out the excess flour. Melt the chocolate in a double
  boiler or a bowl over a pan of simmering water. Set aside to cool to
  lukewarm.
  
  Beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until the whites cling to the
  beater. Add about 1/4 cup of the sugar and beat until the whites form
  stiff, unwavering peaks. Cream the butter and the other (about) 1/4 cup of
  the sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the melted chocolate
  and beat in the egg yolks one at a time.
  
  With a rubber spatula, stir about 1/3 of the beaten egg whites into the
  chocolate mixture, then pour the chocolate mixture over the rest of the
  whites.  Sprinkle the flour lightly on top.  Gently fold the mixture
  together until no white streaks remain. Pour the batter into the prepared
  pan, spreading it evenly with a rubber spatula. Bake in the middle of the
  oven for 15 to 18 minutes, or until the cake shrinks slightly away from the
  sides of the pan and a knife inserted in the middle comes out clean. It
  will still be very flat. Loosen the cake from the pan with a sharp knife
  around the sides and turn it out onto a rack to cool. (Put the rack over
  the pan and flip the whole thing over to keep the cake from breaking.)
  
  TO MAKE FILLING:  In a small, heavy saucepan, combine the cream and
  chocolate and stir over medium heat until the chocolate dissolves. Then
  reduce the heat to very low and simmer, stirring constantly, until the
  mixture thickens to the consistency of a pudding. Pour it into a bowl and
  refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
  
  When the mixture is very cold, pour in the rum and vanilla and beat with a
  whisk or beater until the filling is smooth and creamy and forms soft peaks
  when the beater is lifted.  Do not over-beat or you will get butter. (If
  this should happen, don't despair; chocolate buttercream makes a perfectly
  fine filling.)
  
  Cut the cake in half to make two layers, each about 8 1/2 inches wide.
  Spread the filling over one layer and set the other layer on top. Smooth
  out the edges with a spatula. If one of the cake layers should break, use
  it on the bottom. Refrigerate on a rack for about 1 hour.

           See Part 1
 
  : Continued from Part 1
  
  TO MAKE GLAZE:   In a small, heavy saucepan, heat the sugar, water and
  chocolate over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar and
  chocolate are dissolved. Make sure the sugar is fully dissolved or you will
  get a grainy glaze. Cover the pan and let the glaze cool for about 20
  minutes.
  
  Set a jelly-roll pan on a table with one short edge propped up.  Put the
  rack with the cake on something else so that it is suspended level over the
  pan but offset about 2 inches so that you can reach down into the lower pan
  with a spoon. Hold the pan with the glaze about 2 inches over the cake and
  pour the glaze on the cake. Using a large spoon, scoop up the glaze that
  collects in the jelly-roll pan and put it back on the cake. Keep doing this
  until the glaze begins to stop flowing smoothly. You should end up with a
  thick, even layer of glaze on the cake.
  
  Refrigerate the cake until the glaze is firm, 10 to 20 minutes. Serve by
  cutting into 35 small, equal pieces, 5 in each row across and 7 in each row
  down.  For cutting, use a sharp knife that has been dipped in warm water
  and wiped off between slices. Keep refrigerated, but for maximum flavor,
  allow to come to room temperature before serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Serving these chocolate cream slices will guarantee the success of any
  endeavor.  The name is pronounced, approximately, rrigo yanshi (trilled r).
  This recipe comes from "The Cooking of Vienna's Empire" and is, of course,
  Hungarian.  A friend of mine describes the Hungarians as the people who
  taught the Viennese how to bake. Yield: Makes 35.
  
  *  Fine granulated sugar is not the same thing as confectioner's sugar.
  Regular granulated sugar will work ok for the glaze, just make sure it is
  fully dissolved.  You can avoid lots of chopping by using chocolate chips;
  one cup of chips equals about 6 oz. chips.
  
  : Difficulty:  Quite difficult.  For experienced dessert cooks only.
  : Time:  several hours.
  : Precision:  measure carefully.

    3/4 c  Flour
    1/4 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Unsalted butter; softened

      3    Eggs
      2 ts Vanilla
      4 oz Unsweetened chocolate
           -melted and cooled
      1 c  Milk chocolate chips
      1 c  Chopped walnuts
     12    REGULAR sized marshmallows
 
  Stir together cocoa powder, flour and salt.  Set aside.  Cream butter and
  sugar until light and fluffy.  Add eggs and beat until thick and
  lemon-colored, about 2 minutes.  Blend in vanilla and chocolate.  Slowly
  add cocoa-flour mixture, mixing until combined.  Stir in chocolate chips
  and walnuts.
  
  Arrange marshmallows on sides in generously butter and floured 13 X 9"
  pan, spacing evenly and allowing 1 1/2" border between marshmallows and
  sides of pan.  Spoon some thick batter over marshmallows, covering them as
  much as possible.  Evenly fill in center of pan with remaining batter.
  (Do not add batter to space between marshmallows and side of pan - batter
  will spread during baking.)
  
  Place pan on rack in center of 350 degree oven.  Bake until wood pick
  inserted in center comes out moist from melted chocolate (not batter),
  about 25 minutes.  Let cool completely on rack. Cut into 12 (2 1/2")
  squares.
  
  Refrigerate until chilled.  Using wide metal spatula, carefully transfer
  brownies to serving platter. (Or wrap airtight and store in refrigerator
  up to 1 day or freeze up to 3 months.)  Serve chilled or at room
  temperature.

      Yield: 2 Dozen
 
      4 c  Powdered sugar
           -(yes, four cups!)
      8 oz Cream cheese (one
           -large package or

  NOTES:
  
  *  Easy-to-make candies with chocolate and cream cheese -- Here's a good
  recipe for lazy chocolate freaks.  They're not as good as the ones you buy
  in good candy stores, but they're still yummy.
  
  *  If you're adventurous, try substituting the liqueur of your choice for
  the vanilla.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 2 hours chilling, 20 minutes rolling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      1 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
      1 c  Old water; or brewed coffee
      2 ts Vanilla extract; (pure)
      2 tb Vinegar
 
  :       Preheat oven to 375.
  
  :       Sift together flour, cocoa, baking soda, salt, and sugar into an
  ungreased 8-inch square or 9-inch round cake pan.  In a 2-cup measuring
  cup, measure and mix together the oil, water or coffee, and vanilla.  Pour
  the liquid ingredients into the baking pan and mix the batter with a fork
  or small whisk.  When the batter is smooth, add the vinegar and stir in
  quickly.  There will be pale swirls in the batter where the vinegar is
  reacting with the baking soda.  Stir just until the vinegar is evenly
  distributed throughout the batter.  Bake for 25 to 30 minutes.

  To top the cake, I pureed a bag of (thawed) frozen raspberries and added a
  few drops of lemon juice, then strained through a seive. I was going to
  sprinkle some powdered sugar on top, but I realized I didn't have any
  *yikes*, so i just mixed in a little regular sugar.  I spooned a little of
  this on top of each piece of cake (as well as underneath it), and then
  sprinkled fresh raspberries on top.  It was wonderful.  The color of the
  pureed raspberries alone is enough to make me love this dessert.   The cake
  was great too-- wonderfully dark and moist.  A perfect contrast to the
  tartness of the berries.

      Title: Steve's Chocolate Chip Cookies
 Categories: Cookie
      Yield: 2 Dozen
 
    1/2 lb Butter (2 sticks)
  1 1/2 c  Dark brown sugar
      2    Eggs
      2 t  Vanilla extract
  2 1/2 c  Flour, all-purpose
      1 t  Baking soda
      1 lb Chocolate chips
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Cream butter and sugar in a mixing bowl
  until creamy. Spend some time and make sure it is well mixed. Add eggs and
  vanilla and mix well. Add flour and soda, again mixing well. Add chocolate
  chips. If it doesn't look like enough, then add some more.
  
  Make big, thick cookies, big enough so that you get only 2 dozen of them
  out of this recipe. Put them on a lightly-greased baking sheet. Put the
  cookies in the oven, close the door quickly, and turn the heat down to 350
  degrees F. Bake for 10 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Rich, thick, crunchy chocolate chip cookies.  Yield:  makes 2 dozen.
  
  *  The use of real ingredients instead of imitation ingredients cannot be
  overemphasized.  Chocolate-flavored chips, margarine, vanilla flavoring and
  other such atrocities will completely destroy this recipe. I use Challenge
  butter and Ghirardelli chocolate.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy if you have a machine that can cream sugar and butter,
  moderate otherwise.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 10 minutes cooking, 10 minutes cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: Swedish Chocolate Cake
 Categories: Cake
      Yield: 1 Cake
 
      1 c  Shortening
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      3    Eggs
      2 oz Baking chocolate
           -(unsweetened), melted
      2 c  Cake flour
      2 t  Baking powder
      1 t  Salt
    1/4 t  Baking soda
      1 c  Cream, heavy
      2 t  Vanilla extract
 
  Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.  Butter a Bundt pan and sprinkle with about
  2 T dry bread crumbs, until it is well-coated. This makes a much better
  crust than flour does.
  
  In a large bowl, add the sugar to the shortening and cream well. Blend in
  the eggs, one at a time, and beat well. Stir in the melted chocolate.
  
  Sift together the dry ingredients.  Combine the cream and vanilla extract.
  Add to the chocolate mixture alternately with the dry ingredients,
  beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Pour the batter into the pan
  and bake for 50-60 minutes. Cool the cake in the pan a few minutes before
  removing.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A rich chocolate Bundt cake -- I got this recipe from my mom, who got it
  from an American book called Swedish Baking. I like to make this because it
  does not need to be frosted, which makes it an easy dessert. Yield: one
  Bundt cake.
  
  *  This is not an authentic Swedish recipe because their flour is different
  enough to cause problems in baking.  However, the results seem authentic.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking.
  : Precision:  measure carefully.

  Recipe by: Jessica Chaiken <11JCHAIKEN@GALLUA.GALLAUDET.EDU> Preparing the
  Genoise Sponge Cake:  Preliminaries.  Using the pastry brush, butter an
  8-inch (4 cup) stainless steel bowl (one you can bake in) quite generously
  and coat with flour (knock out the excess).
  
  Preheat oven to 350 F.  Cake batter:  Beat eggs and sugar in bowl of mixer
  for 5 minutes until thick, fluffy and tripled in volume.  Rapidly sift and
  in flour with big rubber spatula and scoop batter into prepared bowl.  bake
  middle level of preheated oven for 35 to 45 minutes until toothpick stuck i
  middle comes out clean.  Turn out onto rack to cool completely (1 hour)
  before proceeding.
  
  Melt the chocolate: Bring 2 inches of water to simmer and set bowl over it,
  add 5 oz of chocolate and remove from heat.  When completely melted, remove
  bowl from water and let cool to room temp.
  
  Whip cream into soft peaks and set bowl over ice water.  Fold half the
  cream into cooled (but liquid) chocolate; when incorporated, fold in the re
  to complete the mousse.
  
  Assembling the cake:  (Taste the OJ to be sure it's sweet enough and add
  Grand Marnier if desired.  Shave off crusty top of cake (it won't absorb
  the OJ) Use a serrated knife to slice the Genoise into 3 layers of equal
  thickness.  Line 8 inch bowl with plastic wrap.  Fit round top piece of cak
  into bowl, brush with about 4 tab of OJ.  Spoon 1/3 of the mousse onto
  soaked layer and strew on a handful of raspberries.  Place the next layer
  ontop of the mousse, brush with 1/3 cup of OJ and spoon on rest of mousse,
  a handful of raspberries and put on the last layer of cake.  Brusk on the l
  of the juice.Bring the hanging edges of plastic over the top, cover with
  another piece of plastic and refrigerate for several hours before decoratin
  
  Making chocolate icing:  Melt remaining chocolate in a bowl over simmering
  water (same as mousse)  Remove plastic covering from cake and unmold
  domed-side up onto a rack, then peel off and discard plastic.  Lightly damp
  your work surface so a 12 inch sheet of plastic wrap will adhere.  Using
  rubber spatula, spread a thin 10-11 inch disk of cool liquid chocolate in t
  center of the sheet.  Rapidly slide plastic ito the bowl, so chocolate disc
  covers bottom and sides of bowl.  gently drop the chilled cake, domed side
  down, into bowl, fold plastic wrap over it and refrigerate.
  
  Makeing chocolate leaves: Dip the inside of each leaf into remaining melted
  chocolate and place on a plate, coated side up.  Refrigerate until chocolat
  hardens.
  
  Decorating cake:  Remove cake from fridge and fold back wrap.  Turn
  domed-side up onto serving cake and lift off plastic wrap.  Sprinkle with
  dusting of powder.  Make a ring of raspberries around edge of cake and pour
  a little raspeberry sauce over them.  Affix chocolate leaves to cake (with
  melted chocolate, after you've removed the green part).
  
  Raspberry sauce: Puree raspberries with 1/2 cup sugar in a blender or food
  processor.  Add lemon juice, taste, adjust the flavor if necessary. Push
  the sauce through

           -----white chocolate mousse
           -layer-----
      2 tb Coconut rum; (such as
           -malibu)
      1 tb Water
      2 ts Vanilla extract
      2 ts Unflavored powdered gelatin
      8 oz White chocolate; coarsely
           -chopped
    3/4 c  Milk
      1 c  Heavy cream
 
  Recipe by: webmaster@godiva.com Preparation Time: 2:45 Make the dark
  chocolate mousse layer:
  
   1. Place the coffee and vanilla in a small cup. Sprinkle the gelatin over
  the mixture and let the gelatin soften for 5 minutes.
  
   2. In a medium bowl, whisk the yolks until blended.
  
   3. In a heavy, medium saucepan, combine 3/4 cup of the cream, the milk and
  sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until small bubbles
  form around the side of the pan. Remove the pan from the heat. Gradually
  whisk about 3/4 cup of the hot cream mixture into the yolks until blended.
  Pour this mixture back into the saucepan. Continue cooking over medium-low
  heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon for 2 to 4 minutes, until the
  custard has thickened slightly. It is done when you can run your finger
  down the back of the coated spoon and a path remains in the custard for
  several seconds. Do not allow the custard to boil.
  
   4. Remove the pan from the heat and immediately strain the custard into a
  stainless steel bowl. Add the softened gelatin mixture to the custard and
  stir until completely dissolved. Add the chocolate and stir until melted
  and smooth. Set the bowl over a larger bowl containing ice water and stir
  for 5 to 10 minutes, until cool.
   Remove the bowl from the bowl of ice water.
  
   5. In a chilled medium bowl, using a handheld electric mixer, beat the
  remaining l/2 cup of the cream until soft peaks start to form.
   Using a rubber spatula, fold one third of the whipped cream into the
  chocolate mixture. Fold in the remaining whipped cream. Scrape the mousse
  into a 9-by-3-inch springform pan and, using a small offset metal cake
  spatula, smooth it into an even layer. Place the pan in the freezer for 1
  hour, until the mousse is firmly set.
  
  Make the milk chocolate mousse layer:
  
   1. Follow the procedure in the steps above, substituting the ingredients
  listed for the milk chocolate mousse layer for those in the dark chocolate
  mousse layer, and pouring the milk chocolate mousse over the dark chocolate
  mousse layer in the pan. Place the pan in the freezer for 1 hour, until the
  mousse is firmly set.
  
  Make the white chocolate mousse layer:
  
   1. Place the rum, water and vanilla in a small, heatproof cup.
   Sprinkle the gelatin over the mixture and allow it to soften for 5
  minutes. Place the cup with the softened gelatin in a small pan with enough
  water to come halfway up the sides of the cup. Heat the gelatin mixture in
  hot, not simmering, water. Stir the gelatin frequently for 3 to 5 minutes,
  or until the gelatin granules dissolve completely and the mixture is clear.
  Remove the pan from the heat, leaving the cup in the water to keep the
  gelatin mixture warm until ready to use.
  
   2. Place the chocolate in a large bowl. In a small saucepan over medium
  heat, bring the milk to a gentle boil. Pour the hot milk over the chocolate
  and let the mixture stand for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate. Add the
  warm gelatin mixture and whisk until smooth. Place the bowl over a larger
  bowl of ice water and stir for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the mixture is
  cool.
  
   3. In a chilled, medium bowl, using a handheld electric mixer, beat the
  cream at medium speed just until it begins to form soft mounds. Do not
  overbeat or the mousse will be grainy. Fold

   Transfer the white chocolate mixture to a mixer bowl, and beat until it

  chocolate mixture, smooth the top and cover with plastic wrap.  Refrigerate
  until firm, 3 hours.
   Lift up the foil to unold the terrine.  Remove the foil and cut the therri
  into 1/2 inch thick slices.  Spoon a pool of chocolate sauce onto each plat
  and arrange a slice on top.  Let it stand for 5 minutes before serving.

      2    Large egg yolks

----------------------------------FROSTING----------------------------------
      2    Vanilla beans
  1 1/4 c  Whipping cream
    1/2 c  Sugar
      4    Large egg yolks
    1/8 ts Salt
      1 lb Bittersweet chocolate (not
           Unsweetened) or semi-
           Sweet, finely chopped
    3/4 c  Unsalted butter(1 1/2 cubes)
           Cut into pieces, room temp

  rounds. Butter paper.
       Bring water and coffee powder to a boil in a heavy saucepan.
  remove from heat. Add cocoa powder and whisk until smooth. Cool
  completely.
       Sift flour, baking powder baking soda and salt into medium bowl.
  In a large bowl, beat butter with an electric mixer until fluffy. Add
  sugar to butter in 4 additions, beating well after each addition and
  scaping down sides of bowl occasionally. Add eggs and yolks 1 at a time,
  beating just to blend after each addition. Using rubber spatula, mix dry

      Title: Truffles
 Categories: Sweets, Christmas, Candy
      Yield: 36 candies
 
    1/2 lb Chocolate, semisweet;choppd
    2/3 c  Cream, heavy
  1 1/2 tb Brandy; or cognac
      2 tb Butter; room temp
           Cocoa powder; unsweetened
  2 3/4 oz Sprinkles, chocolate
 
  Put chopped chocolate in bowl.  Bring cream in saucepan just
  to boil and pour all at once onto chocolate.  Whisk briskly
  until mixture is smooth.  Add brandy and whisk again until
  smooth.  Refrigerate for 30 minutes, until thickened and
  completely cool.
  
  With rubber spatula or wooden spoon, stir and mash butter onto
  chocolate mixture, bit by bit, until butter is completely
  incorporated.  Mixture will thicken.  Return to fridge to chill
  until firm but not hard; the idea is to bring the chocolate to
  the point at which it is chlled enough to hold a shape but still
  soft enough to mold easily.
  
  Keeping your hands generously dusted with cocoa, shape bits of
  chocolate mixture into 1" balls.  If chocolate mixture softens
  too much while you are shaping balls, chill briefly in fridge.
  Roll each ball in cocoa powder or chocolate sprinkles until
  well-coated; roll sprinkle-coated balls around on waxed paper
  to set sprinkles.  As you finish truffles, set aside on waxed
  paper; they will firm up as they rest.
  
  Place truffles in paper candy cups and store in layers in
  airtight container with waxed paper between layers.  If you want
  truffles to have a firm texture, you may keep them in the fridge
  for up to three weeks, or in the freezer for up to three months.
  
  Hazelnut truffles: Add 1/4 c ground toasted hazelnuts when you
  add brandy.  Omit cocoa powder and chocolate sprinkles and
  instead roll truffles in 1/2 c ground toasted hazelnuts.
  
  Orange truffles: Add 2 ts grated orange peel when you add
  Cointreau instead of brandy.  Omit cocoa powder and chocolate
  sprinkles and instead roll truffles in grated white chocolate.
  (To grate white chocolate, freeze a 4-oz piece of white
  chocolate for a few minutes to harden it.  Grate half of piece
  at a time, returning second half to freezer until needed.)
  
  Mocha truffles: Use 1 ts instant coffee dissolved in 1-1/2 tb
  hot coffee (not a typo!)  for brandy.  Roll each truffle in
  cocoa powder and gently press a chocolate coffee bean on top.
  
  Author's note: making truffles is almost as messy as making mud
  pies!  You'll have to wash your hands after every 8-10 balls
  of chocolate.
  
  Truffles are the royalty of homemade candy -- small spheres of
  smooth, flavored chocolate, coated with sprinkles, cocoa powder,
  chopped nuts, or grated chocolate.  Simple but elegant; it may
  surprise you to find out just how simple.

      Yield: 1 servings
 
     10 oz White chcoclate; broken in
           -20 pcs
      4 tb Water
      2 c  Heavy cream
 
  Recipe by: Janet Morrissey <janetm@MAGNUS1.COM> Heat 1 inch of water in the
  bottom half of a double boiler over low heat. When the water is hot (do not
  allow to simmer), place white chocolate and 4 tablespoons of water in the
  top half of the double boiler. Using a rubber spatula, constantly stir the
  white chocolate and water until melted, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from
  heat and keep at room temperature until needed.
  
  Place the heavy cream in a well-chilled bowl of an electric mixer fitted
  with a well-chilled balloon whip.  Mix on high until stiff, about 1 minute.
  Remove the bowl from the mixer.  Using a hand-held whisk, vigorously whisk
  1/3 of the whipped cream into the melted white chocolate. Scrape down the
  bowl with a rubber spatula, and continue to whisk until smooth and
  thoroughly combined.  Add the combined whipped cream and white chocolate to
  the remaining whipped cream and use a rubber spatula to fold together until
  smooth.
  
  Transfer to a container and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours before serving.

      Title: White Chocolate Lasagna with Peanut Ice Cream & Hot Fudge
 Categories: Chocolate, Decadent, Dessert
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  3 1/2 c  Half & half
      8    Egg yolks
  1 3/4 c  Sugar
      2 ts Vanilla
    1/2 c  Smooth peanut butter
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
      1 c  Unsalted dry-roasted peanuts
           Coarsely chopped(about 5 oz)
      3 oz Bars white chocolate; broken
           In half widthwise
     16 oz Bittersweet chocolate
      8 oz Unsalted butter
      1 c  Evaporated milk
           Mint sprigs for garnish
 
  In medium saucepan, scald the half & half over medium heat, set aside. In
  medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, 3/4 cup sugar, a pinch of salt,
  and 1 tsp of the vanilla.  Gradually whisk in the half & half and transfer
  to the saucepan.  Cook this mixture over moderate heat, stirring
  constantly, until just thick enough to coat the back of a spoon (165 on a
  candy thermometer).  This will take 10-15 minutes.  DO NOT bring to a boil
  or you'll have a curdled mess on your hands.  Remove from heat and whisk
  in the peanut butter, then add the cream. Strain this custard into a bowl
  and refrigerate, stirring occasionally, until well chilled.  In the
  meantime, line a 10-by-15 inch jelly roll pan with wax paper.  Transfer
  custard to a Donvier or other ice cream freezer and freeze until thickened
  but still pourable.  Add peanuts.  Pour mixture into the jelly roll pan,
  spread evenly, cover, and freeze overnight.
  
  Prepare sugar syrup by mixing the remaining 1 cup of sugar with 1 cup of
  water.  Bring to a boil to dissolve the sugar, then remove from heat and
  set aside 'til later.
  
  Preheat oven on lowest setting for 5 minutes, then turn it off. Place the
  6 pieces of white chocolate on a large baking sheet lined with wax paper.
  Place in the warm oven until soft enough to yield when pressed by a
  finger, about 6 minutes.  Using a metal spatula, transfer a piece of
  softened chocolate to an individual piece of wax paper (at least 12 inches
  long) and cover with a second sheet of paper.  Using a large heavy rolling
  pin, gently roll the chocolate between the paper to form a thin sheet of
  chocolate, about 11 by 4 inches.  Set each sheet of chocolate aside while
  you repeat this with the rest of the chocolate. Line 3 baking sheets with
  wax paper.  When the white chocolate is cooled and firm, remove the top
  piece of paper from each chocolate sheet. Using a pizza wheel or long
  sharp knife, trim the edges of each sheet to make a neat 3-by-10-inch
  rectangle, then cut each rectangle crosswise to form two 3-by-5-inch
  pieces.  Transfer 4 rectangles to each of the prepared baking sheets.
  Keep cool.
  
  In a double boiler, melt the bittersweet chocolate with the butter,
  stirring until smooth.  Transfer to a bowl.  Whisk in 1 cup of the
  reserved sugar syrup.  Stir in the evaporated milk and 1 tsp. vanilla. Set
  aside, covered.  Note:  this sauce can be made up to 1 week in advance and
  kept, covered, in the fridge.
  
  With a pizza cutter or thin sharp knife, cut the ice cream into ten
  3-by-5-inch rectangles.  There will be a little left over; do what you
  will with it. ;-)  With a spatula, place a piece of the ice cream on each
  of the 4 pieces of white chocolate.  Top each with another piece of
  chocolate, then another layer of ice cream, then another piece of
  chocolate.  Freeze for 3 to 4 hours.
  
  To serve, remove the assembled lasagnas from the freezer and allow to
  soften slightly at room temperature for a few minutes.  Gently reheat the
  fudge sauce in the top of a double boiler or in the microwave. Place each
  of the portions to serving plates, spoon fudge sauce over, garnish with
  mint, and serve immediately.

  Recipe by: "Leo, Debbie" <leodeb@HQ.HHMI.ORG> * I buy large good quality

  Preheat oven to 375 F Mix all dry ingredients together in a separate bowl
  In a large bowl, cream butter and sugars until fluffy.  Add vanilla and
  egg--mix well. Slowly add dry ingredients to butter/sugar mixture--mix well
  Add chocolate and nuts Spoon onto lightly greased cookie sheets (I use
  cushionaire--no burning)
    Make whatever size you what--I tend to make them large because it saves
  time Bake 8-12 minutes, depending on size of cookies--they should not
  brown, more of a golden color Cool on rack
  
  BTW:  I usually make a double batch of the dough, separate into halves, and
  add regular chocolate chunks and pecans to one (and maybe some coconut),
  white chocolate and macadamias to the other--two cookies with half the work

  FROM:      Derek Maddox (The Tally System - 912-328-6183 - (1:36)  Posting
  other day reminded me of another favorite cake around our house.  This Whit
  Chocolate Pound Cake is a lot lighter than the other, and is delicious with
  fresh strawberries or raspberries. I've even been known to sneak a piece of
  this cake for breakfast (when the kids aren't looking). The recipe comes
  from the "White Chocolate Cookbook" by Janice Henderson. There's lots more
  where this came from if you want them.
  
   White Chocolate Pound Cake  Position a rack in the center and preheat oven
  inch fluted tube pan.  Dust with flour; tap out the excess. Sprinkle the
  pecans over the bottom.
  
   Using an electric mixer set at medium speed, beat the butter in a large
  bowl until light and fluffy, then add the sugar, 1 cup at a time, beating
  well after each addition.
  
   Blend in the cream and white chocolate.  Add the eggs, one at a time,
  beating well after each addition.  Into a large bowl, sift the flour with
  the salt and baking soda.  Mix the flour mixture into the cream mixture, 1
  cup at a time, just until blended.
  
   Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until a cake tester inserte
  in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour and 15 minutes to 1
  hour and 30 minutes.  Transfer the cake in the pan to a wire rack and cool
  15 minutes.  Loosen the cake from the edges of the pan with a metal spatula
  and invert onto the wire rack.  Cool completely. Through a fine-mesh sieve,
  sprinkle confectioners' sugar over the top of the cake. store at room
  temperature, wrapped airtight.
  
   One note on melting white chocolate:  Since the fats in white chocolates
  melt at different temperatures, and since the milk proteins tend to clump i
  overheated, melting white chocolate can be very frustrating. I've found tha
  the easiest method is to chop the chocolate into small pieces and melt them
  in the microwave. Microwave at high power for 1 minute, then stir. If
  necessary, continue the process for additional 30-second intervals until
  completely melted. Microwave only until smooth; DO NOT OVERHEAT!!!  Whateve
  and have not had a moment's peace since.  B-)  ** -=> this comes from the b

      Title: Wickedly Rich Double Fudge Brownies
 Categories: Brownies, Chocolate
      Yield: 20 small brow
 
---------------------------------BROWNIES:---------------------------------
      5 oz Unsweetened chocolate
     10 T  Unsalted butter
  1 1/3 c  Granulated sugar
    1/8 ts Salt
      4 ts Vanilla extract
      3 lg Eggs, at room temperature
    3/4 c  Plus 2 T sifted AP flour
    1/2 c  Coarsely chopped walnuts

---------------------------MOCHA FUDGE FROSTING:---------------------------
      4 oz Semisweet chocolate
      2 ts Vanilla extract
    3/4 ts Instant coffee granules
    1/3 c  Evaporated milk
      2 T  Light corn syrup
      1 T  Unsalted butter; softened
      2 ts Cognac or dark rum;(opt.)
    1/2 c  Coarsely chopped walnuts
 
  1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 325^F. Line a
  9-inch square baking pan with aluminum foil so that the foil extends 2
  inches beyond two opposite sides of the pan. Fold the overhang down along
  the outside of the pan.  Lightly butter the bottom of the foil-lined pan.
  
  2. In the top of a double boiler set over hot, not simmering water, melt
  the chocolate with the butter, stirring frequently until smooth. Remove
  the top part of the double boiler from the bottom and transfer the
  chocolate mixture to a large bowl.  Let the chocolate mixture cool for
   about 10 minutes, or until tepid.
  
  3. Add the sugar and the salt to the tepid chocolate mixture. Using a
  hand-held electric mixer set at low speed, beat the mixture for 15 to 20
  seconds, until blended. Scrape the bottom and side of the bowl with a
  rubber spatula. Beat in the corn syrup and vanilla.
  
  4. One at a time, add the eggs, beating for no longer than 5 seconds after
  each addition. Using a rubber spatula, stir in the flour mixture. Stir in
  the walnuts.
  
  5. Scrape the batter into the pan and spread it evenly with the back of a
  spoon.
  
  6. Bake the brownies for 30 to 35 minutes, until a wooden toothpick
  inserted into the center comes out sightly creamy.  Do not overbake the
  brownies. Cool the brownies completely in the pan set on a wire rack.
  
  Make the mocha fudge frosting:
  
  7. In a small cup, stir together vanilla and coffee granules.
  
  8. Melt the chocolate by one of the following two methods:
  
  a) In a microwave oven - place coarsely chopped chocolate in a
  microwave-safe container and microwave at MEDIUM (50% power) for 1.1/2 to
  4 minutes, until the chocolate turns shiny. Remove the container from the
  microwave and stir the chocolate until completely melted. Stir milk and
  white chocolates after about 1.1/2 minutes. Because of their milk
  proteins, they need to be stirred sooner than dark chocolate. (If
  overheated, these chocolates may become grainy)
  
  b) In a double boiler - place coarsely chopped chocolate in the top of a
  double boiler over hot, not simmering, water. Melt the chocolate, stirring
  until smooth. Remove the top part of the double boiler from the bottom.
  
  9. Put the milk, corn syrup, butter and vanilla/coffee mixture into the
  container of an electric blender. If desired, add the cognac or rum. Add
  the melted chocolate. Cover and blend at low speed for 20 to 45 seconds,
  until the frosting is thick and creamy. Use the frosting immediately.
  
  10. Using a small offset metal cake spatula, frost the brownies with the
  mocha fudge frosting. Sprinkle the walnuts over the top of the frosted
  brownies. Chill the brownies in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the
  frosting has set. Cover the pan with aluminum foil and let the brownies
  sit overnight at room temperature.
  
  11. Using the two ends of the foil as a handle, lift the brownies out of
  the pan. With a large, sharp knife, cut the brownies from the foil and
  store then in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days.
