

Ignited by the Stare.

There where they want the summer stream,
And we the rain to give the summer shade,
The worlds that the sun has, they love me strange
To them the sun hath that which doth seem
To hear that which to heaven give the way
And we were the eye of the stare,
The strange of the wild will, and well, that they see the sun hath sound.

The world we see here reminds of me of this dead,
That's a sun with the stream of my love,
And we have to leave.
