# RNN

This is a code for an RNN. The Neural Newtwork was trained on two different datasets - One of Chocolate Recipies and another of Poetry. 
The results are as follows:
1) Poetry 


Ignited by the Stare.

There where they want the summer stream,<br/>
And we the rain to give the summer shade,<br/>
The worlds that the sun has, they love me strange<br/>
To them the sun hath that which doth seem<br/>
To hear that which to heaven give the way<br/>
And we were the eye of the stare,<br/>
The strange of the wild will, and well, that they see the sun hath sound.<br/>
<br/>
The world we see here reminds of me of this dead,<br/>
That's a sun with the stream of my love,<br/>
And we have to leave. <br/>
<br/>
This was the result after 9 epochs of training.<br/>
